Weiterhin sind in diesem Zusammenhang Fat-Clients und Thin-Client zu unterscheiden. Rich-Clients werden manchmal auch als Smart-Clients bezeichnet und bieten die bestm\u00f6gliche Performance und Skalierung von Applikationen. Ein Rich-Client besteht aus einer GUI -Applikation und integriert dazu: Die Pr\u00e4sentation d.h. die Bereitstellung einer interaktiven Schnittstelle f\u00fcr den Benutzer durch die Applikation. Die Anwendungslogik, die die eigentliche Funktionalit\u00e4t einer Applikation zur Verf\u00fcgung stellt. Dabei k\u00f6nnen einem Rich-Client die folgenden Charakteristika zugeordnet werden: Native Widgets werden unterst\u00fctzt, Drag-und-Drop-Funktionen sind m\u00f6glich, Unabh\u00e4ngigkeit von einer Plattform, einheitliches Komponentenmodell oder Update -Funktionalit\u00e4ten sind integriert. Funktionsverteilung beim Rich-Client Da der Rich-Client spezifischen Code der Applikation enth\u00e4lt, gibt es in Folge dessen auch keine neutrale L\u00f6sung als Standard f\u00fcr einen Rich Client. Die Definition geht hier einen Schritt weiter, und fasst applikations\u00fcbergreifende Funktionen in einem Framework zusammen, das dann als Rich-Client Plattform bezeichnet wird. F\u00fcr eine bessere Einordnung der Zusammenh\u00e4nge seien hier auch noch die Begriffe des Fat-Clients und des Thin-Clients aus Sicht des Software-Engineerings erl\u00e4utert, um dann kurz deren Unterschiede zum Rich Client hervorzuheben. Thin Client. Ist das genaue Gegenteil eines Rich-Clients. Ein Thin-Client enth\u00e4lt keinerlei eigene applikationsspezifische Funktionalit\u00e4t, diese wird komplett vom Server bereitgestellt. Die applikationsspezifischen Funktionen werden hier in Form von Webseiten dargestellt. Aufgrund der eingeschr\u00e4nkten Visualisierung und Interaktion der grafischen Benutzerschnitt-stellen (GUI) spricht man auch von schlechter Usability eines Thin-Clients. Hier ist zum Beispiel der Client Teil des Browser-Fensters oder Drag-und-Drop-Funktionen werden nicht unterst\u00fctzt. Ein erheblicher Nachteil ist es, dass sonstige beim Client installierte Software nur schwer integriert werden kann. Dem stehen aber die einfache Verteilung und Installation neuer Applikationen und die Unabh\u00e4ngigkeit von bestimmten Plattformen des Thin-Clients gegen\u00fcber. Fat Client. Hier liegt sowohl die Funktionalit\u00e4t der Pr\u00e4sentation als auch die der Anwendungslogik beim Client. Dies garantiert dem Client nicht nur einen hohen Komfort f\u00fcr den Benutzer sondern auch durch die Offline-F\u00e4higkeit eine geringe Abh\u00e4ngigkeit von einem Netzwerk. Der guten Usability steht ein h\u00f6herer Aufwand bei der Aktualisierung und Installation neuer Versionen der Applikation gegen\u00fcber. Fat-Clients unterst\u00fctzen monolithische Strukturen und sind h\u00e4ufig unabh\u00e4ngig von einer Plattform. W\u00e4hrend die Unterschiede des Rich-Clients zum Thin-Client offensichtlich sind, gibt es diesbez\u00fcglich hinsichtlich der Merkmale von Rich-Client und Fat-Client doch \u00dcberschneidungen.

A rich client is a networked computer falling between a fat client and a thin client. Fat refers to a computer with many locally-stored programs/resources and little network resource dependence. Thin refers to a computer with few locally-stored programs/resources and great network resource dependence. Thus, a rich client depends both on locally-stored programs/resources and those available through the network server. Advertisement Techopedia Explains Rich Client A rich client balances program/resource dependence and hard drive or connected drive resources on its devices with program/resource dependence on the network server\u2019s hard drive or connected drives and devices. The system designer determines this balance, depending on whether lengthy computations must be accomplished by the client or the server. As an example, the computer handling a simple drawing\u2019s editing with sophisticated software stored on a network server is often considered as a thin client. A computer handling most of a complex drawing\u2019s editing with locally-stored sophisticated editing software may be considered a fat client. Editing or viewing accessibility to the drawing and editing software is determined by the system designer.

Do they still have to appear on the desktop or should they be replaced with a web application? Rich client or web application \u2026 In this entry, we present software options in the form of a rich client and also as a web-based solution, including the features and pros and cons of both. You cannot compare one with the other as every technology has its own specific purpose for its corresponding application. \u2026 or something in-between ? We believed that there had to be an interim solution to make even complex applications accessible online, OPTANO, for example. This meant combining the advantages of the rich client and the web application with one another. Let\u2019s take a look at the rich client first of all. The Rich Client Rich clients are applications which perform the following functions directly on the client system: The presentation, namely the interactive interface for the user and the application logic which provides the actual functionality of an application. Parts of the application software are implemented on the application server as well as on the rich client, for example in the case of desktop applications or on mobile platforms. In this way it is necessary to install these clients directly on the user appliance. Diagram \u2013 function allocation with rich client Rich clients have the following features: They provide the best possible performance and scaling of applications. They are based on a unified component model so that a lot of useful components have already been implemented. Drag-and-drop functions are possible, as well as support for native widgets. Using rich client visualization and the interaction of graphic user interfaces leads to excellent software usability. It is easy to operate and implement desired functions. In this way, rich clients enable the development of complex interfaces for complex applications and offer the user a high level of functionality and control. Updates are performed with client server models such as the rich client with the support of integrated update functionalities. For example, by using an automatic online update function in the client itself or supported by a web starter which is executed before the actual client. However, allocating and installing software as well as managing the client can end up being expensive for\n[4]: URL: https://pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/rich-client --- Title: Definition of rich client | PCMag --- Body: Definition of rich client | PCMag Home Encyclopedia R rich client Browse Encyclopedia A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 0-9 An application in the user's computer that retrieves data from the Internet. Written in a programming language such as C/C++ or Java, which has complete access to all the functions in the computer, the rich client program runs stand-alone without the need of a Web browser. The First Internet Programming - A Step Backward In the mid-1990s, applications were converted to Web server architectures that relied on the Web browser for the user interface and JavaScript programming embedded in the Web pages. Such browser-based applications exhibited \"page-at-a-time\" behavior. The entire page had to be reloaded each time any data was sent to the server, and the experience was more akin to early online applications of the 1960s and 1970s. Moving Along As the Internet became mainstream, scripting languages were enhanced to deliver more of the functionality of regular programming languages, and AJAX came along to make Web pages work with more fluidity (see AJAX) even though they still ran from within the Web browser. All the while, the increasing speed of the computer CPUs and Internet connections began to blur the distinction between Web-based applications and local applications for the user. See RIA and smart client. Encyclopedia Rich Client In 1990, this encyclopedia was made available as a Windows application. The user sees two scrolling windows, a lookup routine and only a handful of features, but under the covers, it took more than 500 pages of C source code to create the program. The continuous scrolling of multimedia objects from A to Z requires access to low-level Windows functions. In 2003, it was turned into a rich Windows client. The software, text and images are downloaded from the Web, but the program does not run from the Web browser. As a rich client, it retained all the features users loved on their PCs with the added benefit of automatic updating. Our Rich Client The program resides in the Windows PC like any other local application but is automatically updated from the Web.\n[5]: URL: https://docs.cyberark.com/product-doc/onlinehelp/idaptive/latest/en/content/applications/appsscriptref/o365blockextaccessscript.htm --- Title: Office 365 block external access to rich clients --- Body: Office 365 block external access to rich clients Office 365 block external access to rich clients For Office 365, this policy script blocks external access to Microsoft rich clients such as Outlook, ActiveSync, Lync, etc. Office 2013 and 2016 client applications when using Modern Authentication with ADAL do not support this feature.

Next steps The information in this article can be used to troubleshoot unexpected sign-in outcomes related to Conditional Access using error messages and Azure AD sign-ins log. Select \"all\" consequences The Conditional Access framework provides you with a great configuration flexibility. However, great flexibility also means that you should carefully review each configuration policy before releasing it to avoid undesirable results. In this context, you should pay special attention to assignments affecting complete sets such as all users / groups / cloud apps. Organizations should avoid the following configurations: For all users, all cloud apps: Block access - This configuration blocks your entire organization. Require device to be marked as compliant - For users that haven't enrolled their devices yet, this policy blocks all access including access to the Intune portal. If you're an administrator without an enrolled device, this policy blocks you from getting back into the Azure portal to change the policy. Require Hybrid Azure AD domain joined device - This policy block access has also the potential to block access for all users in your organization if they don't have a hybrid Azure AD joined device. Require app protection policy - This policy block access has also the potential to block access for all users in your organization if you don't have an Intune policy. If you're an administrator without a client application that has an Intune app protection policy, this policy blocks you from getting back into portals such as Intune and Azure. For all users, all cloud apps, all device platforms: Block access - This configuration blocks your entire organization. Conditional Access sign-in interrupt The first way is to review the error message that appears. For problems signing in when using a web browser, the error page itself has detailed information.

This all appeared to be working nicely until I noticed the other day that quite a few users are attempting and succeeding at logins via Exchange Activesync, despite being linked to a conditional access policy that explicitly blocks it. Azure AD Signins confirm that they're failing the policy, but the login attempts are still reported as successes. Example: Have yall ever seen something like this happen, and can you offer any suggestions? I could disable Exchange Activesync entirely in the Exchange Online admin portal, but I'd prefer not to kick 100 plus users off their mail client all at once.

With Intune and Conditional Access, you can protect access to Microsoft 365 services like Exchange Online and SharePoint Online, and various other services. This capability allows you to make sure that only devices that are enrolled with Intune and compliant with the Conditional Access rules that you set in Intune or Azure Active Directory have access to your company resources. Requirements for Conditional Access The following requirements must be met for Conditional Access to work: The device must be enrolled in mobile device management (MDM) and managed by Intune. Both the user and the device must be compliant with the assigned Intune compliance policies. By default, the user must be assigned a device compliance policy. This can depend on the configuration of the setting Mark devices with no compliance policy assigned as which is under Device Compliance > Compliance Policy Settings in the Intune admin portal. Exchange ActiveSync must be activated on the device if the user is using the device's native mail client rather than Outlook. This happens automatically for iOS/iPadOS and Android Knox devices. For on-premise Exchange, your Intune Exchange Connector must be properly configured. For more information, see Troubleshooting the Exchange Connector in Microsoft Intune. For on-premise Skype, you must configure Hybrid Modern Authentication. See Hybrid Modern Auth Overview. You can view these conditions for each device in the Azure portal and in the device inventory report. Devices appear compliant but users are still blocked Ensure that the user has an Intune license assigned for proper compliance evaluation. Non-Knox Android devices won't be granted access until the user clicks the Get Started Now link in the quarantine email they receive. This applies even if the user is already enrolled in Intune.

Here are a couple of examples where the conditional access may be marked as failure even if the status is marked as success:\n\n1. Block Access Policy: Let's say you have a conditional access policy in place that blocks access to a certain application or resource based on specific conditions, such as the user's location or device compliance. In this case, if a user successfully logs in with valid credentials but the conditional access policy determines that the user does not meet the specified conditions, the status may still be marked as success but the conditional access will be marked as failure. This means that although the user's login was successful, they were not granted access to the application or resource.\n\n2. Legacy Authentication: Another scenario where the conditional access may be marked as failure even with a success status is when you have a conditional access policy that is designed to block legacy authentication methods. For example, if the policy is set to block access when using legacy Exchange ActiveSync, and a user successfully logs in using Exchange ActiveSync, the status may still be marked as success but the conditional access policy will be marked as failure. This indicates that the user's login was allowed, but the conditional access policy failed to block the use of the legacy authentication method.\n\nThese are just a couple of examples, and there could be other scenarios where the conditional access may be marked as failure despite a success status. It's important to review your specific conditional access policies and their associated conditions to understand why the conditional access may not align with the login status."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks for the clarification.

Microsoft Azure Files OneDrive vs SharePoint vs Azure | Steadfast Solutions In the past, businesses relied on USB sticks or hard drives to store and share files. But, due to the advancements in technology, cloud computing has made it possible for users in business networks to easily and quickly transfer files regardless of their locations or the devices they\u2019re using. Depending on your storage, file sharing, and collaboration needs, you\u2019ll choose a tool that has the right features and is within your budget. Comparing OneDrive, SharePoint, and Azure may seem a little difficult because the tools have so much in common. Nonetheless, these three are not the same. Even with this overlap between tools in the Microsoft software-verse, we\u2019ll try and pinpoint the differences between these three file storage and sharing solutions to help pick the right option for your business. OneDrive OneDrive allows you to save all your photos/files and quickly access them from any device regardless of your location. This is a great tech model for anyone who wants to experience the freedom of accessing, editing, and sharing their files or photos on any device. That also means that you won\u2019t lose your files and images even if your device is damaged or gets lost. OneDrive allows users to consistently stay connected with the people they choose to share their files and photos. So, if some of your business partners or remote employees are abroad, you can still share photos, files, folders with them and avoid the hassle of dealing with thumb drives and large email attachments\u2014you send a full OneDrive link through email or text. Besides, files on OneDrive are always encrypted, whether on transit or not, to ensure they don\u2019t appear malicious. Apart from being an online cabinet for storing documents or files, OneDrive is also a reliable platform for versioning and sharing work projects. With the roll-back functionality, you can rest assured that you can retrieve files anytime if you delete or corrupt them accidentally. In addition, the Personal Vault section on OneDrive is designed to ensure that users can securely store their information using a password. OneDrive is an essential tool among the three that is tailored for personal than commercial use.

In a previous company I migrated the company file shares to Azure using File Sync, which turned the on-premise file server to a caching server. This allowed the users to continue working with the network shares without anything changing from their perspective. I'm curious about the option of moving everything to SharePoint/Teams to get files completey in cloud? Any limitations with this. It would be approx 1TB of data that is currently on our network shares. I like the idea on the surface of having it all in cloud so data can be accessed from anywhere without a VPN, but it would be a shift in functionality for staff and maybe that is it's own headache for IT? Spice (9) Reply (8) flag Report rashley pimiento 8 Replies _V_ chipotle Sep 30th, 2020 at 7:44 AM I haven't messed much with Azure files, because I'm a huge Sharepoint fan. I still prefer on-premise (which can also be accessed externally if you configure it to be so), but Sharepoint adds so much flexibility and functionality. Yes, if your users are accustomed to a old-school file server directory structure, there will be a learning curve for them, but it's worth it IMO. Plus, there are a ton of benefits for IT, even if you have to spend a lot of time up-front training. One advantage is you can push both document access and document management back onto the users. Department heads can manage their own page in Sharepoint, and therefore manage user access to the documents they own. With on-premise Sharepoint you can even have sub-directories (sites) so each department can customize their own page if they desire. Users can recover their own deleted documents through the recycle bin, as well as easily recover earlier document versions. Sharepoint is a great way to handle shared calendars so they no longer have to be managed via Exchange or Outlook, document search functionality is better, and you can generally migrate a lot of other information to Sharepoint, giving you a single (or at least fewer) platform(s) to manage. flag Report 3 found\n[3]: URL: https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2231133-sharepoint-vs-azure-files --- Title: Sharepoint vs Azure files - Office 365 - Spiceworks --- Body: Sharepoint vs Azure files - Office 365 Home Cloud Microsoft Office 365 Sharepoint vs Azure files Posted by pedramhaghzaban on Sep 10th, 2019 at 7:05 AM Needs answer Microsoft Office 365 Hi everyone, I know this question might asked before but our situation is little bit different compare to others. Currently our office has a file server and we recently started using 365 and my goal is to completely move to cloud ( we just have a file server and a dc). And by completely I mean using Azure AD instead of current on premise and use either Sharepoint or Azure files to replace the on premise file server. Most of our files are either documents such as excel, word, pdf, and pictures. Currently the total amount of size is 877GB. But it will be smaller that that since some of them are not important or are installation files. One option is Sharepoint but the challenging part was recreating the permissions (It is already done) and download/upload each file when the user is working on them. The advantage of it that I'm seeing is the multi platform which gives users on pretty much any operating system to access the files. It is also part of our subscription which means it is free for now. The other option is Azure Files but to my Knowledge in past couple days that I've been researching, we need a VM for it either on-prem or over the Azure which adds around $338.43 for both Azure storage and a VM. Now my question is which one of these 2 solutions would work better for now and future?

One of the reasons why I consider choosing Blob Storage over SP Document Libraries is because I use PowerApps. PowerApps can interact with Data from both Blob Storage and SP. But if you are using the PowerApp to interact with a SP list, you can only manage up to 2500 items in your SP list. That is very limiting in a business environment where you are quick to exceed these 2500 items. With Blob Storage a limit of that kind does not exist.

The drive will be hosting mostly word/excel and pdf files. It doesn't require user permissions as well as multi user file access. It looks to me that Azure Files would be the most seamless replacement for the users. Potentially they won't see any difference. Might be just a bit laggier. It would be another shared drive. I wouldn't be using File Sync. Is OneDrive a comparable solution for sharing files? The biggest requirement is to have all the files in one location so everyone can see them. Would I be able to create a folder in OneDrive that will be shared/synced between all the users? Another consideration is backup. I understand that Azure files doesn't backup by default and I will have to setup some snapshotting solution. Does OneDrive backup and is it incremental backup so that I can restore a file at any point in time? I did some research and it sounds like a lot of people are not recommending Azure files because of cost, possibility of SMB port being blocked by ISP, and lack of user access controls.

SharePoint also offers features like workflow management, search functionality, and integration with other Microsoft 365 apps, making it a comprehensive solution for document management and collaboration.\n\nNow, imagine you work for a software development company that needs a centralized file storage solution accessible by developers using different operating systems and tools. You need a simple and scalable file sharing solution that can be easily integrated with your applications. In this scenario, Azure Files would be a suitable option. You can create SMB file shares in Azure and have your developers access them from their local machines or virtual machines in the cloud. Azure Files also provides REST API access, allowing seamless integration with your applications for file storage and retrieval. It offers the scalability and flexibility needed for a development environment.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how SharePoint and Azure Files cater to different needs and use cases. SharePoint is more extensive and feature-rich for organizations that require robust document management and collaboration capabilities, while Azure Files is a specialized solution for centralized file storage and sharing across multiple systems or applications."}, {"role": "user", "content": "which one is better to use in modern times?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The choice between SharePoint and Azure Files depends on your specific requirements and use case.

Pedersen's Azure & Docker blog Simon J.K. Pedersen's Azure & Docker blog Interesting articles about Azure, Docker and Office 365 Running MacOS using Virtual Box in Azure By Simon J.K. Pedersen on July 17, 2017 \u2022 ( 7 Comments ) Last week Microsoft finally released their new Azure Virtual Machine series Dv3 and Ev3, besides being based on the latest Intel hardware, these machine are also running Windows Server 2016 as the host OS which supports nested virtualization. Why is that interesting you might ask? Well, it is interesting because now it is possible to run hyper visors inside an Azure VM. To me as a developer that is pretty cool, because now I can actually create a development machine in the cloud, install hyper-v on it and run my mobile emulators or even use docker for Windows, which is dependent on Hyper-V. Furthermore, as I\u2019m going to show in this blog post, I can also install an open source Hypervisor like VirtualBox and use that to emulate a Mac, of course that can also be done on a local machine, but the benefit of running it in the cloud is that it can be online 24\u00d77 which is great if you need a build or test server. (Beware that Apple licensing is probably not going to approve of this, but let\u2019s save that concern for another day). So what do you need: You need 1 Azure VM based on Ev3 or Dv3, for my testing I used a Standard_E2_v3 hosted in West Europe (Currently the new machine are only in West US2, East US2, Southeast Asia and West Europe). I just picked Windows Data Center 2016 and installed everything from the azure portal. No ARM templates for my testing purpose. Once the machine is provisioned, you need VirtualBox. You can download that from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads. For some reason it downloaded super slow from Azure, so I downloaded i on my local machine and uploaded it through remote desktop. With VirtualBox installed it is time, to install the operation system of your choice on your nested virtual machine. As I promised I\u2019m going to install MacOS Sierra. Luckily, some more Apple Savy people have described how to do, the guide I followed are https://techsviewer.com/install-macos-sierra-virtualbox-windows. Basically the guide boils down to download a base image, then setup a VM in virtual box\n[2]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/azure/storage/files/storage-files-introduction --- Title:

Pipelines with Anka Build - Veertu On-demand macOS VMs in Azure DevOps Pipelines with Anka Build September 16, 2021 By Nathan Pierce - Developer Relations Manager In this blog post, we\u2019re going to show you how to set up and utilize on-demand macOS VMs for iOS building and testing inside of Azure DevOps Pipelines using Veertu\u2019s Anka Build solution. Microsoft has a vast library of services under Azure DevOps which support teams in planning work, collaborating on code, and automating building and testing. We\u2019d love to tell you all about them, but we\u2019ll focus specifically on Pipelines and self-hosted Azure Pipelines Agents. You can find more information about Azure DevOps on their documentation site. Anka Build virtualization solution enables the creation and management of macOS VMs on mac host machines in a container-like manner. With Anka Build, you can create macOS VM images/templates, store and manage them in a central Anka registry, and provision on-demand instances on a cluster of either local or external mac hardware. Another huge benefit of Anka is the ability to run multiple VMs on a single machine, easily doubling the macOS fleet your team uses for automation. Note: For this guide, you\u2019ll need a single macOS machine to download, configure, and register the Azure Pipelines Agents on. It needs to have the Anka package installed, and at least one VM Template/Tag stored on it. You\u2019ll also need an Azure DevOps Project set up within your Azure organization. Let\u2019s start with a description of Azure Pipelines. From the What is Azure Pipelines? documentation: \u201cAzure Pipelines automatically builds and tests code projects to make them available to others. It works with just about any language or project type. Azure Pipelines combines continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) to test and build your code and ship it to any target.\u201d One of the great parts of Azure Pipelines is its use of YAML to define jobs and steps. This provides a similar experience to Github Actions (see our blog on how that works) and several other CI/CT/CD tools that speed up the adoption or migration into Azure DevOps. Here is the example YAML we\u2019ll describe: trigger: - main pool: 'Anka macOS' parameters: - name: anka_vm_name displayName: \"Anka VM Template Name or UUID\" type: string default: '11.5.2' - name: anka_vm_tag_name displayName: \"Anka VM Template Name or UUID\" type: string default: 'vanilla+port-forward-22+brew-git' -\n[4]: URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42848516/windows-azure-vm-mac-to-build-ionic-app-for-ios-devices --- Title: macos - Windows Azure VM (Mac) to build Ionic app for ios devices ... --- Body: macos - Windows Azure VM (Mac) to build Ionic app for ios devices - Stack Overflow Windows Azure VM (Mac) to build Ionic app for ios devices Ask Question 2 I'm developing Ionic2/Angular apps using an Ionic framework.I have no problem with Android.My question here is, can I use Windows Azure VM (Mac) to build my app for ios devices?

Start a Free Trial Product Feature Risk level: Medium (should be achieved) Rule ID: VirtualMachines-023 Ensure that Accelerated Networking feature is enabled for your Azure virtual machines (VMs) in order to provide low latency and high throughput for the network interfaces (NICs) attached to the VMs. Accelerated networking enables single root input/output virtualization (SR-IOV) for virtual machines, vastly improving its networking performance. This high-performance pathway bypasses the host from the datapath, reducing latency, jitter and CPU utilization, so it can be used with the most demanding network workloads that can be installed on the supported VM types. This rule resolution is part of the Conformity Security & Compliance tool for Azure. Performance efficiency Without accelerated networking, all network traffic in and out of the virtual machine must traverse the host and the virtual switch. The virtual switch provides all policy enforcement, such as network security groups, Access Control Lists (ACLs), isolation, and other network virtualized services. But with accelerated networking, network traffic arrives at the virtual machine's network interface (NIC) and then it is forwarded to the VM. All network policies that the virtual switch applies are now offloaded and implemented at the hardware level and this reduces the overall latency. Applying the policy to the hardware enables the NIC to forward network traffic directly to the virtual machine (VM), bypassing the host and the virtual switch, while maintaining the policy enforcement that was applied to the host. The benefits of accelerated networking have a real impact when communicating across Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) or connecting to on-premises, as this feature provides low latency and high throughput. Note: Accelerated networking is supported only on virtual machine instances with 4 or more vCPUs. Supported series are: D/Dsv3, E/Esv3, Fsv2, Lsv2, Ms/Mms and Ms/Mmsv2. Audit To determine if your Azure virtual machines (VMs) are configured with accelerated networking, perform the following actions: Using Azure Portal 01 Sign in to Azure Management Console. 02 Navigate to All resources blade at https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseAll to access all your Microsoft Azure resources. 03 Choose the Azure subscription that you want to access from\n", "messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!

Microsoft Defender for Cloud (previous Azure Defender) is available in Azure, with Microsoft Defender for Cloud it is possible to manage devices in Azure. By using Azure Arc, it is possible to onboard on-premise servers or servers from a different cloud factor to monitor the security posture and onboard devices directly to Defender for Endpoint. Introduction In this blog, I will explain the usage of Azure Arc, Defender for Cloud, and Defender for Endpoint with the main goal \u2013 onboard non-Azure devices with Defender for Cloud directly into Defender for Endpoint. Onboard non-Azure machines into Azure Arc with Azure Arc-enabled servers Enable Defender for Cloud Enable Defender for Cloud \u2013 Auto Provisioning Integrate Defender for Cloud and Defender for Endpoint Notice: Blog will not go in-depth in all the options of Azure Arc. The focus of this blog is the onboarding process between Azure Arc \u2013 Defender for Cloud and Defender for Endpoint. More in-depth blogs are coming for all the components. Blog request? Don\u2019t hesitate to email me, or ping me on other socials. What is Azure Arc? Firstly a small introduction to Azure Arc in a nutshell. Azure Arc is a hybrid cloud solution that extends Azure Management services and Azure services to on-premises, edge, and multi-cloud environments. This means that you can run Azure services from anywhere within the environment restrictions. For example: Enable Defender for Cloud for on-premises machines and deploy Defender for Endpoint silently. For more Azure Arc information see: Azure Arc overview Prerequisites Azure Arc For connecting machines into Azure Arc there are some requirements needed. Note: Azure Arc-enabled servers does not support installing the agent on machines running in Azure, Azure Stack Hub or Azure Stack Edge. All of them are already configured as Azure VM. The following Windows operating systems are supported for Azure Arc Connected machines. Note: Linux is possible too \u2013 a separate blog for Linux is coming soon. This blog focussing only on Windows.

What are the benefits of Microsoft Defender for SQL? Is there a performance impact from deploying Microsoft Defender for SQL on machines? What kind of alerts does Microsoft Defender for SQL provide? Next steps Note Azure Security Center and Azure Defender are now called Microsoft Defender for Cloud. We've also renamed Azure Defender plans to Microsoft Defender plans. For example, Azure Defender for Storage is now Microsoft Defender for Storage. Learn more about the recent renaming of Microsoft security services. Microsoft Defender for SQL includes two Microsoft Defender plans that extend Microsoft Defender for Cloud's data security package to secure your databases and their data wherever they're located. Microsoft Defender for SQL includes functionalities for discovering and mitigating potential database vulnerabilities, and detecting anomalous activities that could indicate a threat to your databases.

Next steps This article explains how connectivity between Azure AD Connect and Azure AD works and how to troubleshoot connectivity issues. These issues are most likely to be seen in an environment with a proxy server. Troubleshoot connectivity issues in the installation wizard Azure AD Connect uses the MSAL library for authentication. The installation wizard and the sync engine proper require machine.config to be properly configured since these two are .NET applications. Note Azure AD Connect v1.6.xx.x uses the ADAL library. The ADAL library is being depricated and support will end in June 2022. Microsoft recommends that you upgrade to the latest version of Azure AD Connect v2. In this article, we show how Fabrikam connects to Azure AD through its proxy. The proxy server is named fabrikamproxy and is using port 8080. First we need to make sure machine.config is correctly configured and Microsoft Azure AD Sync service has been restarted once after the machine.config file update. Note In some non-Microsoft blogs, it is documented that changes should be made to miiserver.exe.config instead. However, this file is overwritten on every upgrade so even if it works during initial install, the system stops working on first upgrade. For that reason, the recommendation is to update machine.config instead. The proxy server must also have the required URLs opened. The official list is documented in Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges. Of these URLs, the following table is the absolute bare minimum to be able to connect to Azure AD at all. This list does not include any optional features, such as password writeback, or Azure AD Connect Health. It is documented here to help in troubleshooting for the initial configuration.

This method applies to situations in which an object or attribute doesn't synchronize to Azure Active AD and doesn't display any errors on the sync engine, in the Application viewer logs, or in the Azure AD logs. It's easy to get lost in the details if there's no obvious error. However, by using best practices, you can isolate the issue and provide insights for Microsoft Support engineers. As you apply this troubleshooting method to your environment, over time, you'll be able to do the following steps: Troubleshoot the sync engine logic from end to end. Resolve synchronization issues more efficiently. Identify issues more quickly by predicting the step in which they'll occur. Identify the starting point for reviewing data. Determine the optimal resolution. The steps that are provided here start at the local Active Directory level and progress toward Azure AD. These steps are the most common direction of synchronization. However, the same principles apply to the inverse direction (for example, for attribute writeback). Prerequisites For a better understanding of this article, first read the following prerequisite articles for a better understanding of how to search for an object in different sources (AD, AD CS, MV, and so on), and to understand how to check the connectors and lineage of an object. Azure AD Connect: Accounts and permissions Troubleshoot an object that is not synchronizing with Azure Active Directory Troubleshoot object synchronization with Azure AD Connect sync Bad troubleshooting practices The DirSyncEnabled flag in Azure AD controls whether the tenant is prepared to accept synchronization of objects from on-premises AD. We've seen many customers fall into the habit of disabling DirSync on the tenant while troubleshooting object or attribute synchronization issues. It's easy to turn off directory synchronization by running the following PowerShell cmdlet: PowerShell Copy Set-MsolDirSyncEnabled -EnableDirSync $false \"Please DON'T and\n[4]: URL: https://sikich.com/insight/troubleshooting-microsoft-azure-ad-connect-powershell --- Title: Troubleshooting Microsoft Azure AD Connect PowerShell ... --- Body: Troubleshooting Microsoft Azure AD Connect PowerShell - Sikich LLP Microsoft Azure AD Connect PowerShell Troubleshooter Microsoft Azure AD Connect PowerShell Troubleshooter January 20, 2021 Reading Time: 4 minutes For connecting your on-premise Active Directory environment to Microsoft\u2019s Azure directory, the two choices available are to either synchronize the local directory to Azure\u2019s directory or to use federation to point users authenticating to Azure services to your local environment. To synchronize the environments, the best (and only currently supported) tool available is Microsoft\u2019s current iteration of Azure AD Connect. Originally labeled as Windows Azure Active Directory Sync (dirsync) and then Azure Active Directory Sync, the current version is Azure AD Connect, or shortened as AAD Connect. Having a local Active Directory synced to Azure Active Directory is often done during Office 365 migrations where IT wants users to use the same password to log into the Office 365 services as they use to sign into their local Windows Active Directory joined PCs. AAD Connect is available here for download: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=47594 The tool synchronizes most attributes automatically every 30 minutes. It synchronizes passwords even more often. Once it is installed in your environment, there is built-in logging so administrations can see what is going on via the Azure AD Connect Synchronization Service tool. Additionally, built into the application is a PowerShell Troubleshooter. To access the Troubleshooter, launch the tool. Be aware whenever the tool is launched that all synchronizations are paused. Continue through the tool by clicking Configure. There are many options to choose from at this point, and likely the most common one is \u201cCustomize synchronization options\u201d as this is where the tool is reconfigured as needed. To troubleshoot the current configuration, you can click on the last choice: Troubleshoot. Select it and click Next. The full walkthrough of how to use the Troubleshooter from Microsoft is here: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=872964 Click Launch to start the tool. You will be prompted what troubleshooting steps you would like to perform. Let us run through an example where the local Windows Active Directory environment has one forest with 2 sibling domains. The issue is that users from one domain can log into and access Azure services without a problem, while users from the second domain get an error about an invalid password when signing into Azure services. AAD Connect is configured for password hash synchronization. Users show up from both domains in Azure AD Users.\n[5]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/cloud-sync/how-to-troubleshoot --- Title: Azure AD Connect cloud sync troubleshooting | Microsoft Docs --- Body: Azure AD Connect cloud sync troubleshooting | Microsoft Docs Azure Active Directory Cloud sync Cloud sync troubleshooting Article 03/09/2022 8 minutes to read 8 contributors In this article Agent problems Object synchronization problems Provisioning quarantined problems Repair the cloud sync service account Password writeback Next steps Cloud sync has many different dependencies and interactions, which can give rise to various problems. This article helps you troubleshoot these problems. It introduces the typical areas for you to focus on, how to gather additional information, and the various techniques you can use to track down problems. Agent problems When you troubleshoot agent problems, you verify that the agent was installed correctly, and that it communicates with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). In particular, some of the first things that you want to verify with the agent are: Is it installed? Is the agent running locally? Is the agent in the portal? Is the agent marked as healthy? You can verify these items in the Azure portal and on the local server that's running the agent. Azure portal agent verification To verify that Azure detects the agent, and that the agent is healthy, follow these steps: Sign in to the Azure portal. On the left, select Azure Active Directory > Azure AD Connect. In the center, select Manage sync. On the Azure AD Connect cloud sync screen, select Review all agents. On the On-premises provisioning agents screen, you see the agents you've installed. Verify that the agent in question is there. If all is well, you will see the active (green) status for the agent. Verify the required open ports Verify that the Azure AD Connect provisioning agent is able to communicate successfully with Azure datacenters. If there's a firewall in the path, make sure that the following ports to outbound traffic are open: Port number How it's used 80 Downloading certificate revocation lists (CRLs), while validating the TLS/SSL certificate. 443 Handling all outbound communication with the Application Proxy service. If your firewall enforces traffic according to originating users, also open ports 80 and 443 for traffic from Windows services that run as a network service.

AzCopy is a command-line utility for transferring data to and from Azure storage. You can download and install it from the official Microsoft website [[2]](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/azcopy-command-line-utilitymicrosoft-azure-storage/30d975da-523a-4379-816b-251ec84317cd).\n\nIf AzCopy is already installed, but you're still getting the \"AzCopy is not recognized\" error, it's likely because the AzCopy executable is not in your system's PATH variable. The PATH variable determines which directories are searched for executable files when you run a command. To fix this issue, you can either add the AzCopy executable to the PATH or provide the full path to the AzCopy executable when running the command.\n\nTo add the AzCopy executable to the PATH variable on Windows, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Control Panel and go to System and Security.\n2. Click on System.\n3. Click on Advanced system settings.\n4. In the System Properties window, click on the Environment Variables button.\n5. In the Environment Variables window, find the PATH variable under System variables and click on Edit.\n6. Add the directory path where the AzCopy executable is located (for example, \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\Azure\\AzCopy\") to the list of paths.\n7. Click OK to save the changes.\n\nAfter adding the AzCopy executable to the PATH variable, you should be able to run the AzCopy command from any command prompt or PowerShell session.\n\nIf you prefer not to modify the PATH variable, you can provide the full path to the AzCopy executable when running the command. For example, if the AzCopy executable is located in \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\Azure\\AzCopy\", you can run the command like this:\n\n```powershell\n\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\Azure\\AzCopy\\AzCopy.exe\" /Source:source /Dest:destination\n```\n\nReplace \"source\" and \"destination\" with the appropriate source and destination values for your scenario.\n\nI hope this helps!

A newcomer onto the Infrastructure as Code scene in Azure is a project called Bicep. What is Terraform? What is Bicep? What about Bicep vs. Terraform? Which solution should you choose for your IaC configuration language? Let\u2019s find out. Automated Workflows & Infrastructure as Code The public cloud world has led to an explosion of cloud-based infrastructure in leading public cloud service provider environments. Along with new ways of doing things, tooling, and types of infrastructure, the cloud has led to a new automation workflow for infrastructure engineers known as Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Infrastructure as code allows IT operations to \u201cdescribe\u201d infrastructure as code and enables the code to provision infrastructure in the cloud in the way it is described and defined in the IaC. It has opened the door to a developer-minded approach to infrastructure. The birth of DevOps has resulted in mashing up the world of code development with IT operations. Exciting DevOps tools have been born from this movement of infrastructure into code. What is declarative IaC? Infrastructure as Code provides a way to describe or declare what infrastructure looks like using code. The declarative nature of Infrastructure as Code is sometimes referred to as the desired state. In the code, you describe the result of the infrastructure and how it should look after the code runs. The code then builds out the infrastructure as described. Any deviation from this declared state can be remediated using the description of the infrastructure as code. What makes this new approach possible with cloud-native infrastructure? This new method of building infrastructure is made possible by powerful RESTful APIs exposed by public cloud service providers. Public cloud infrastructure environments including Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure provide API endpoints to perform infrastructure operations using calls to the code\u2019s backend APIs. In fact, generally speaking, the GUI cloud dashboards interact with these backend APIs to complete the various actions accomplished from the web UI. The exposed RESTful API endpoints have allowed the\n[3]: URL: https://starwindsoftware.com/blog/bicep-vs-terraform --- Title: Bicep vs. Terraform: Which is Better | StarWind Blog --- Body: Bicep vs. Terraform: Which is Better | StarWind Blog Home StarWind Blog Bicep vs Terraform Bicep vs Terraform Posted by Brandon Lee on December 16, 2021 Tags: Bicep, Microsoft Azure, Terraform There is no question that businesses today are required to move faster, be more agile, and apply technical solutions to problems much more quickly than ever before. But, unfortunately, traditional manual processes can no longer keep up with modern demands on IT operations teams. The world of public cloud infrastructure has been a paradigm shift in how businesses approach infrastructure. Public cloud environments enable organizations to move quickly and in an agile way. The reason for this is automation, and particularly, infrastructure as code (IaC). Hashicorp Terraform is an extremely popular (IaC) option that many companies use today to interact with on-premises and cloud infrastructure, including Microsoft Azure. A new Infrastructure as Code option is a new project driven by Microsoft called Bicep. Let\u2019s take a look at both Terraform and Bicep. How are they similar, and what are the differences? Which option should you choose for your IaC platform? What is Infrastructure as Code? Before comparing Terraform and Bicep, we need to understand the concept of Infrastructure as Code (IaC). What is it exactly, and why is it so important for modern infrastructure deployments? Infrastructure as Code is relatively intuitive in regards to the meaning of the term. You are describing your infrastructure in code blocks. The true birth of Infrastructure as Code was driven by the move to public cloud infrastructure. In public cloud environments such as Amazon AWS, Google GCP, and Microsoft Azure, you can\u2019t physically get your hands on the infrastructure. However, public cloud providers do provide \u201cconsole-based\u201d interfaces that allow manually spinning up VMs, networks, and other necessary resources. The true power of provisioning resources in the public cloud comes from interacting with the infrastructure programmatically. Public cloud environments such as Microsoft Azure expose REST APIs that allow performing actions programmatically instead of using the GUI console. With this capability, organizations can describe their infrastructure in code, perform the actions, create resources, and configure them in an automated fashion. One of the powerful concepts of Infrastructure as Code is the declarative nature of the code. It means you can declare what you want the infrastructure to \u201clook\u201d like, and the code makes that happen. The sheer number of resources and configurations maintained by organizations\n[4]: URL: https://marcusfelling.com/blog/2021/reasons-to-use-bicep-over-terraform --- Title: Reasons to use Bicep over Terraform \u2013 Marcus Felling --- Body: Reasons to use Bicep over Terraform \u2013 Marcus Felling Reasons to use Bicep over Terraform Why would you choose Microsoft\u2019s new Bicep DSL over HashiCorp\u2019s Terraform? I would like to give you my perspective, as someone who ditched ARM templates for Terraform in most of my Infrastructure as Code projects. To set the context of this blog post, I\u2019ll be talking about Azure focused customers. Also, I won\u2019t be going over the basics of what Bicep is (that can be found in README here) or comparing it to other IaC solutions like Pulumi or Farmer. If there is interest, I can cover those in another blog post. This will be a direct comparison to Terraform. Note: Opinions expressed are solely my own and do not express the views or opinions of my employer. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are some great reasons to use Terraform. Multi-cloud support is one of them. Or for some of you who already have large investments in Terraform, starting over may not make sense. If that\u2019s the case, you\u2019re still in good hands. There is a dedicated team at Microsoft responsible for making Terraform on Azure as good as it can possibly be. However, there are some benefits that come with the first class, Azure native, experience of Bicep: Day zero support for all resource types & API versions With Bicep, there will be day 0 support for new resources. Similar to ARM templates, the schema of the resource provider is used directly. With Terraform there is potential for a delay between new Azure resources being released and them being available to create in Terraform. A Terraform community member must add any new Azure features to the Azure Terraform provider. Yes, you can have Terraform deploy an ARM template or use the Azure CLI, but that can get messy stringing it all together, and none of these resources will be tracked by TF state. No state files Terraform\u2019s source of truth is the state file, which comes with some baggage. With the state file, you have an extra file that is critical to your deployments that you need to manage and keep safe. If you lose your state file or it gets overwritten, you could be in a lot of trouble. With Bicep, the state is maintained by Azure. You can perform a what-if (TF Plan equivalent) operation without any state file management.

Fast-forward to 2021 and Microsoft and HashiCorp are playing catch-up to Pulumi and to each other.

Today, we are excited to announce the same feature for Azure Linux VM backups in preview. If you are new to Azure Backup, you can start backing directly from the Azure IaaS VM blade and start using this feature. Value proposition: Instant recovery of files \u2013 Now instantly recover files from the cloud backups of Azure VMs. Whether it\u2019s accidental file deletion or simply validating the backup, instant restore drastically reduces the time to recover your data. Mount application files without restoring them - Our iSCSI-based approach allows you to open/mount application files directly from cloud recovery points to application instances, without having to restore them. For e.g. In case of backup of a Azure Linux VM running mongoDB, you can mount BSON data dumps from the cloud recovery point and quickly validate the backup or retrieve individual items such as tables without having to download the entire data dump. Learn how to instantly recover files from Azure Linux VM backups: Basic requirements The downloaded recovery script can be run on a machine which meets the following requirements. OS of the machine where the script is run (recovery machine) should support/recognize the underlying file-system of the files present in the backed-up Linux VM. Ensure that the OS of the recovery machine is compatible with the backed up VM and the versions are as mentioned in the following table Linux OS Versions Ubuntu 12.04 and above CentOS 6.5 and above RHEL 6.7 and above Debian 7 and above Oracle Linux 6.4 and above The script requires python and bash components to execute and provide a secure connection to the recovery point.

The process applies to the following environments: Linux distributions RHEL 7.6+ Ubuntu 18.04+ SUSE 12+ Azure Disk Encryption single-pass extension Azure Disk Encryption dual-pass extension Scenarios The procedures in this article support the following scenarios: Configure LVM on top of encrypted devices (LVM-on-crypt) Configure RAID on top of encrypted devices (RAID-on-crypt) After the underlying device or devices are encrypted, then you can create the LVM or RAID structures on top of that encrypted layer. The physical volumes (PVs) are created on top of the encrypted layer. The physical volumes are used to create the volume group. You create the volumes and add the required entries on /etc/fstab. In a similar way, the RAID device is created on top of the encrypted layer on the disks. A file system is created on top of the RAID device and added to /etc/fstab as a regular device. Considerations We recommend that you use LVM-on-crypt. RAID is an option when LVM can't be used because of specific application or environment limitations. You'll use the EncryptFormatAll option. For more information about this option, see Use the EncryptFormatAll feature for data disks on Linux VMs. Although you can use this method when you're also encrypting the OS, we're just encrypting data drives here. The procedures assume that you already reviewed the prerequisites in Azure Disk Encryption scenarios on Linux VMs and in Quickstart: Create and encrypt a Linux VM with the Azure CLI. The Azure Disk Encryption dual-pass version is on a deprecation path and should no longer be used on new encryptions. General steps When you're using the \"on-crypt\" configurations, use the process outlined in the following procedures. Note We're using variables throughout the article.

These policies guarantee the required level of service for your VMs because they determine how storage is allocated to the VM. Each VM deployed to a vSAN datastore is assigned at least one VM storage policy. You can assign a VM storage policy in an initial deployment of a VM or when you do other VM operations, such as cloning or migrating. Post-deployment cloudadmin users or equivalent roles can't change the default storage policy for a VM. However, VM storage policy per disk changes is permitted. The Run command lets authorized users change the default or existing VM storage policy to an available policy for a VM post-deployment. There are no changes made on the disk-level VM storage policy. You can always change the disk level VM storage policy as per your requirements. Note Run commands are executed one at a time in the order submitted. In this how-to, you learn how to: List all storage policies Set the storage policy for a VM Specify default storage policy for a cluster Prerequisites Make sure that the minimum level of hosts are met.

This article explains how to recover files and folders from an Azure VM backup. Restoring files and folders is available only for Azure VMs deployed using the Resource Manager model and protected to a Recovery Services vault. Note This feature is available for Azure VMs deployed using the Resource Manager model and protected to a Recovery Services vault. File recovery from an encrypted VM backup isn't supported. Step 1: Generate and download script to browse and recover files To restore files or folders from the recovery point, go to the virtual machine and perform the following steps: Sign in to the Azure portal and in the left pane, select Virtual machines. From the list of virtual machines, select the virtual machine to open that virtual machine's dashboard. In the virtual machine's menu, select Backup to open the Backup dashboard. In the Backup dashboard menu, select File Recovery. 32 The File Recovery menu opens. Important Users should note the performance limitations of this feature. As pointed out in the footnote section of the above blade, this feature should be used when the total size of recovery is not beyond 10 GB and you could get data transfer speeds of around 1 GB per hour From the Select recovery point drop-down menu, select the recovery point that holds the files you want. By default, the latest recovery point is already selected. Select Download Executable (for Windows Azure VMs) or Download Script (for Linux Azure VMs, a Python script is generated) to download the software used to copy files from the recovery point. Azure downloads the executable or script to the local computer.

I have checked the MS website and several other resources. It mentions ExpressRoute Direct as a 'direct connection' but what I don't understand is that if it's direct connection from on-prem to Microsoft Edge location or there is still a provider involved.

This means you need to host a rack in a provider like Equinix, and they will handle setting up the cross connection from your cage directly to Microsoft\u2019s routers and network. It\u2019s essentially a \u201cdirect connection\u201d to the Microsoft backbone, but this has to be done in a hosted data center. For a corporate office with no presence in a data center like that you then leverage Express Route. 6 level 2 learner4397 Op \u00b7 9 mo. ago Thank you so much for responding. This definitely helps.

Supported services Data and connections Technical details ExpressRoute SKU scope access ExpressRoute premium ExpressRoute Local ExpressRoute for Microsoft 365 Route filters for Microsoft peering ExpressRoute Direct Global Reach Privacy What is ExpressRoute? ExpressRoute is an Azure service that lets you create private connections between Microsoft datacenters and infrastructure that's on your premises or in a colocation facility. ExpressRoute connections don't go over the public Internet, and offer higher security, reliability, and speeds with lower latencies than typical connections over the Internet. What are the benefits of using ExpressRoute and private network connections? ExpressRoute connections don't go over the public Internet. They offer higher security, reliability, and speeds, with lower and consistent latencies than typical connections over the Internet. In some cases, using ExpressRoute connections to transfer data between on-premises devices and Azure can yield significant cost benefits. Where is the service available? See this page for service location and availability: ExpressRoute partners and locations. How can I use ExpressRoute to connect to Microsoft if I don't have partnerships with one of the ExpressRoute-carrier partners? You can select a regional carrier and land Ethernet connections to one of the supported exchange provider locations. You can then peer with Microsoft at the provider location. Check the last section of ExpressRoute partners and locations to see if your service provider is present in any of the exchange locations. You can then order an ExpressRoute circuit through the service provider to connect to Azure. How much does ExpressRoute cost? Check pricing details for pricing information. If I pay for an ExpressRoute circuit of a given bandwidth, do I have this bandwidth allocated for ingress and egress traffic separately? Yes, the ExpressRoute circuit bandwidth is duplex. For example, if you purchase a 200 mbps ExpressRoute circuit, you are procuring 200 mbps for ingress traffic and 200 mbps for egress traffic. If I pay for an ExpressRoute circuit of a given bandwidth, does the private connection I purchase from my network service provider have to be the same speed? No. You can purchase a private connection of any speed from your service provider. However, your connection to Azure is limited to the ExpressRoute circuit bandwidth that you purchase.

Connectivity providers may offer one or more connectivity models. You can work with your connectivity provider to pick the model that works best for you. Co-located at a cloud exchange If you're co-located in a facility with a cloud exchange, you can order virtual cross-connections to the Microsoft cloud through the co-location provider\u2019s Ethernet exchange. Co-location providers can offer either Layer 2 cross-connections, or managed Layer 3 cross-connections between your infrastructure in the co-location facility and the Microsoft cloud. Point-to-point Ethernet connections You can connect your on-premises datacenters/offices to the Microsoft cloud through point-to-point Ethernet links. Point-to-point Ethernet providers can offer Layer 2 connections, or managed Layer 3 connections between your site and the Microsoft cloud. Any-to-any (IPVPN) networks You can integrate your WAN with the Microsoft cloud. IPVPN providers (typically MPLS VPN) offer any-to-any connectivity between your branch offices and datacenters. The Microsoft cloud can be interconnected to your WAN to make it look just like any other branch office. WAN providers typically offer managed Layer 3 connectivity. ExpressRoute capabilities and features are all identical across all of the above connectivity models.

Azure Backup Vault Vs Site Recovery ... --- Body: What's the Difference? Azure Backup Vault Vs Site Recovery - Royal Discount What\u2019s the Difference? Azure Backup Vault Vs Site Recovery Azure Cloud, Cloud, Data Backup, Tips Business consistency needs vary from organization to organization. Larger IT organizations with heavier dependency on applications require more robust business consistency and disaster recovery. However, smaller, less dependent IT implementations may not need as intensive plans for data back-up and recovery as enterprise-class customers. Microsoft Azure provides two different models from which to choose with its recovery services \u00b7 Backup Vault or the newer Azure Recovery Services Vault \u00b7 Site Recovery Services The names of these two services suggest they cover the same needs, but they are different models. Backup Vault is used to perform backups that most organizations currently use. With Azure, the Backup Vault/Azure Recovery Services Vault replaces older technology with backup to the cloud. With Backup Vault more granular backup and restoration can be done down to individual files. Meanwhile, Site Recovery services is a different model for business recovery altogether. Site Recovery services replicates entire site data, physical servers, VMs and even network services. In this manner, an entire site has redundancy for high availability, failover and failback services. With a Site Recovery subscription, business consistency is achieved through replication either from an on-premise to cloud model or a cloud to cloud model. The distinction between Backup Vault and Site Recovery services is that, while both operate by storing data to the cloud for business consistency and disaster recovery, they achieve similar goals differently. Backup Vault uses the traditional method of backup but without the necessity of tape, using the Azure cloud instead. Site Recovery services achieves business consistency by site replication and failover/failback operations. Azure Backup Vault Azure Backup Vault is a backup solution most familiar to IT personnel where data is backed up so that it can be restored as necessary. The traditional method was to backup to tapes and send them off site. With Azure Backup Vault, tapes and tape drives are no longer necessary as data is backed up to the Azure cloud-based vault. Cost is reduced through the elimination of older equipment and the reduction of restoration time with backed up data always available. Backup Vault works as a cloud-to-cloud implementation where cloud-based VMs and data can be backed-up to the Backup Vault without disruption to services. Additionally, on-premise physical servers and VMs can\n[5]: URL: https://nakibjuris.medium.com/difference-between-azure-backup-azure-site-recovery-a850cc37e352 --- Title: Difference between Azure Backup & Azure Site Recovery ... --- Body: Difference between Azure Backup & Azure Site Recovery. | by M A Nakib | Medium M A Nakib Jul 8, 2020 \u00b7 3 min read Difference between Azure Backup & Azure Site Recovery. Azure Site Recovery Azure Site Recovery (ASR) is a disaster recovery solution for physical servers. The physical server\u2013based environment can be replicated to Azure using ASR. The same approach can be used for migration, where the replicated environment is failed over and then continues to run from Azure. An additional VM or physical machine should be available on-premise to set up the ASR components. A zure Backup does scheduled backup of VMs at specified time intervals to address the data and application resiliency concerns of environments hosted in Azure. If you have stringent recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs) defined in a business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) strategy, Azure Site Recovery (ASR) could be the better choice because it replicates data continuously to a different region in Azure. Note that this service is in preview at the time of writing this book. It is recommended to include ASR in the architecture to enable environment-level resiliency once the service becomes generally available. ASR for Azure VMs can be enabled directly from the Azure portal with minimal configuration steps. While Azure Backup requires the vault be in the same region as IaaS VMs, ASR mandates that to enable replication of IaaS VMs, the vault should be in a different region. This helps ensure the availability of the vault in the event of a disaster affecting Azure datacenters in a specific region. To start ASR configuration for an Azure VM, open the Recovery Services vault \u27a4 Get started \u27a4 Site Recovery \u27a4 Step1: Replicate Application.

This guide shows you how to register a single-page application (\"SPA\") using the Azure portal. Overview of authentication options Many modern web applications are built as client-side single-page applications (\"SPAs\"). Developers write them by using JavaScript or an SPA framework such as Angular, Vue, and React. These applications run on a web browser and have different authentication characteristics than traditional server-side web applications. Azure AD B2C provides two options to enable single-page applications to sign in users and get tokens to access back-end services or web APIs: Authorization code flow (with PKCE) OAuth 2.0 Authorization code flow (with PKCE) allows the application to exchange an authorization code for ID tokens to represent the authenticated user and Access tokens needed to call protected APIs. In addition, it returns Refresh tokens that provide long-term access to resources on behalf of users without requiring interaction with those users. This is the recommended approach. Having limited-lifetime refresh tokens helps your application adapt to modern browser cookie privacy limitations, like Safari ITP. To take advantage of this flow, your application can use an authentication library that supports it, like MSAL.js. Implicit grant flow Some libraries, like MSAL.js 1.x, only support the implicit grant flow or your applications is implemented to use implicit flow. In these cases, Azure AD B2C supports the OAuth 2.0 implicit flow. The implicit grant flow allows the application to get ID and Access tokens. Unlike the authorization code flow, implicit grant flow doesn't return a Refresh token. This authentication flow doesn't include application scenarios that use cross-platform JavaScript frameworks such as Electron and React-Native. Those scenarios require further capabilities for interaction with the native platforms. Prerequisites If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin.

Please refer to https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8252#section-8.2 which says below - The OAuth 2.0 implicit grant authorization flow (defined in Section 4.2 of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749]) generally works with the practice of performing the authorization request in the browser and receiving the authorization response via URI-based inter-app communication. However, as the implicit flow cannot be protected by PKCE [RFC7636] (which is required in Section 8.1), the use of the Implicit Flow with native apps is NOT RECOMMENDED. Access tokens granted via the implicit flow also cannot be refreshed without user interaction, making the authorization code grant flow -- which can issue refresh tokens -- the more practical option for native app authorizations that require refreshing of access tokens.

Although this post works with an Angular App, the concepts (including the twists and tweaks) needed to make it work for Azure AD B2C are universal for Single Page Applications. So even if you have Vue or React, this post could be useful. Why this post (and why not just use the well known Implicit flow)? The browser based Implicit flow is old and The OAuth Working Group has published a document recommending replacing the Implicit flow with the newer Authorization Code flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (we like to simply refer to it as the PKCE flow). Azure AD B2C still supports the Implicit flow (as it has for a long time) but it recently began to recommend the PKCE based flow when creating new apps. So now seems like the perfect time to go along with this and start using it too. This blogpost should get you up and running for new apps, but refactoring apps that worked with the Implicit flow shouldn't be too hard. If you happen to use one of the OpenID Connect certified libraries, the changes to your apps codebase are minimal! But what is this new PKCE flow? It is basically an enhanced version of the Authorization Code flow. To illustrate, follow me through steps in the diagram. This flow is not complex, but understanding this will benefit you if you ever need to troubleshoot login issues. The user clicks a login link or button. The app generates a random code_verifier and derives a code_challenge from that verifier. The app then redirects the user to the Azure AD B2C Authorize endpoint with the code_challenge. The user is redirected to the login page. After supplying the correct credentials the user is redirected back to the app with a authorization code. The app receives the code and posts this code along with the code_verifier (from step 1) to the Azure AD B2C Token endpoint to request an access and id token. After validation Azure AD B2C sends both these tokens back to the app. The user can\n[5]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-register-applications --- Title: Tutorial: Register an application - Azure AD B2C ... --- Body: Tutorial: Register a web application in Azure Active Directory B2C - Azure AD B2C | Microsoft Docs Azure Active Directory B2C Tutorial: Register a web application in Azure Active Directory B2C Article 04/25/2022 6 minutes to read 18 contributors In this article Prerequisites Register a web application Create a client secret Enable ID token implicit grant Next steps Before your applications can interact with Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C), they must be registered in a tenant that you manage.

Of course, you could use other tools like robocopy. Azure Files Sync preserves ACLs too, check this guide. It is a known problem that some ISPs are blocking TCP/445 port. This practice originates from security guidance about legacy and deprecated versions of the SMB protocol. Although SMB 3.0 is an internet-safe protocol (and Azure Files are only using this version), older versions of SMB, especially SMB 1.0 are not. It is correct that building a hybrid connectivity between Azure and your network (Express Route or S2S VPN) and enabling Private Endpoints for Azure Files can mitigate this problem. There is also a general guidance in Azure Docs on how to preserve ACLs when importing data to Azure file shares. Hope this helps. An Unexpected Error has occurred.

I followed instructions to create a Azure File share (TestShare) and a endpoint to allow on prem clients to be able to access it. I gave \"Storage File Data SMB Share Elevated Contributor\" to account \"abc\" for the \"TestShare\" file share I created. I then sign into a server on prem as account \"abc\" where I have data I would like to copy over to the \"TestShare\" using robocopy. I can map the drive on that server with that user. I can browse it, create folders, delete folders, modify folders, and modify NTFS permissions on that \"TestShare\" via Explorer. However when I try to use robocopy and tell it to copy the NTFS permission it errors out with \"ERROR 5 (0x00000005) Copying NTFS Security to Destination Directory Access is denied\" If I take out the copy NTFS permissions switch, it can copy the data fine.

We also have a WvD environment with a few application servers on Azure. We would like to mount the file share with the files synced from our on-premise file server from within WvD (in the same subscription). On-premise with have AD groups linked to NTFS permissions on the file server. These AD groups are synced to AAD DS. We activated the AD DS authentication option in the storage account, mounting the drive in WvD works just fine with the AAD DS credentials. However all users have access to all folders despite the AD groups having been synced both to AAD DS and also via Azure File Sync to the storage account (we can see our groups from AD listed on the mounted file share in WvD). So for some reason the NTFS permissions are not enforced and we can&amp;#39;t figure out why since this is clearly the use case described in this MS document: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-identity-auth-active-directory-domain-service-enable Does anyone have experience in applying this use case or solving similar issues with the NTFS permissions?

We strongly recommend you to review the How it works section to select the right domain service for authentication. The setup is different depending on the domain service you choose. This article focuses on enabling and configuring Azure AD DS for authentication with Azure file shares. If you are new to Azure file shares, we recommend reading our planning guide before reading the following series of articles. Note Azure Files supports Kerberos authentication with Azure AD DS with RC4-HMAC and AES-256 encryption. We recommend using AES-256. Azure Files supports authentication for Azure AD DS with full synchronization with Azure AD. If you have enabled scoped synchronization in Azure AD DS which only sync a limited set of identities from Azure AD, authentication and authorization is not supported. Applies to File share type SMB NFS Standard file shares (GPv2), LRS/ZRS Standard file shares (GPv2), GRS/GZRS Premium file shares (FileStorage), LRS/ZRS Prerequisites Before you enable Azure AD over SMB for Azure file shares, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites: Select or create an Azure AD tenant. You can use a new or existing tenant for Azure AD authentication over SMB. The tenant and the file share that you want to access must be associated with the same subscription. To create a new Azure AD tenant, you can Add an Azure AD tenant and an Azure AD subscription. If you have an existing Azure AD tenant but want to create a new tenant for use with Azure file shares, see Create an Azure Active Directory tenant.

With Azure AD Identity Protection it is possible to protect users based on the Microsoft signals. Azure AD Identity protection is all about risk, detection, and remediation based on the identity level. Microsoft uses threat intelligence to specify risky detection for all users. This blog is about all the parts of Azure AD Identity Protection. What is Azure AD Identity Protection? For several years Azure AD Identity Protection is available with the Azure AD P2 license. Azure AD Identity Protection gives the following key tasks for organizations: Automate detection and remediation for identity risk events Investigate risk Protect users automatically based on risk Identity Protection uses the threat intelligence information from AzureAD and all the threat intelligence information from customers worldwide. Based on the analyzed events Microsoft protects users from threats. Two main risk detection components are part of the Azure AD Identity Protection solution: Sign-in risk User-risk User Risk A user risk represents the probability that a given identity or account is compromised. The user risk detections are calculated offline using the Microsoft internal and external intelligence feed. Leaked credentials Azure AD threat intelligence Sign-in Risk A sign-in risk represents the probability that a given authentication request isn\u2019t authorized by the identity owner. Examples for sign-in risk: Anonymous IP address Atypical travel Malware linked IP address Unfamiliar sign-in properties Leaked credentials Password spray Risk can be calculated in real-time or offline using threat intelligence. More sign-in risk scenarios, later in the blog. Requirements For all the functionality functions, an Azure AD Premium P2 license is necessary. Azure AD Premium P2 is needed for all the Identity Protection features. Configure Azure AD Identity Protection For Azure AD Identity Protection, multiple policies should be enabled to use the full capabilities of Identity Protection. Keep in mind that there will be user impact. User-risk policy Enabling this policy will have an impact on the users that are flagged as risky. Always start small with a pilot group and audit first.

There are two methods how Azure AD Connect will match existing users. When you install Azure AD Connect and you start synchronizing, the Azure AD sync service (in Azure AD) does a check on every new object and try to find an existing object to match. There are three attributes used for this process: userPrincipalName, proxyAddresses, and sourceAnchor/immutableID. Soft-Match Soft-Match will use the properties userPrincipalName and proxyAddresses to match existing users. For the proxyAddresses attribute only the value with SMTP:, that is the primary email address, is used for the evaluation. Hard-Match Hard-Match will use the property sourceAnchor/immutableID. You can only select which property is used as sourceAnchor during the installation of Azure AD Connect as described in their documentation. If the selected sourceAnchor is not of type string, then Azure AD Connect Base64Encode the attribute value to ensure no special characters appear. By default, Azure AD Connect (version 1.1.486.0 and older) uses objectGUID as the sourceAnchor attribute. ObjectGUID is system-generated. So we only have to set the immutableID property of the existing user in our Azure AD to the Base64 encoded string of the ObjectId of the user in our on-premise AD. If you already synchronized your Active Directory then you probably have two users with the same name in your Azure AD. Just follow the following steps to finally merge these users: You have to execute the following OnPrem PowerShell commands on the machine with your on-premise AD and the Azure PowerShell commands via the Azure Cloud Shell. For available PowerShell commands on the Azure Active Directory PowerShell see their documentation. 1. OnPrem: Get ObjectId from AD User $user = Get-ADUser -Filter 'Name -like \"*NAME*\"' 2. OnPrem: immutableId = ToBase64(ObjectId) $immutableid = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($user.ObjectGUID.tobytearray()) $immutableid 3. Azure: Remove duplicated Azure AD User Remove-AzureADUser -ObjectId <objectid> The following PowerShell command prints a list of all users and their ObjectId. Get-AzureADUser 4. Azure: Remove duplicated Azure AD User permanently On the sidemenu there is a menu item called Deleted users. There you can select the user and permanently delete it. 5. Azure: Set immutableId for Azure AD User Set-AzureADUser -ObjectId <objectid> -ImmutableId\n[3]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-authentication-use-email-signin --- Title: Sign-in to \ue000Azure\ue001 AD with email as an alternate \ue000login\ue001 \ue000ID\ue001 ... --- Body: Sign-in to Azure AD with email as an alternate login ID | Microsoft Docs Azure Active Directory Authentication Sign-in to Azure AD with email as an alternate login ID (Preview) Article 12/29/2021 14 minutes to read 13 contributors In this article Before you begin Preview limitations Overview of alternate login ID options Synchronize sign-in email addresses to Azure AD B2B guest user sign-in with an email address Enable user sign-in with an email address Enable staged rollout to test user sign-in with an email address Test user sign-in with an email address Troubleshoot Next steps Note Sign-in to Azure AD with email as an alternate login ID is a public preview feature of Azure Active Directory. For more information about previews, see Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews. Many organizations want to let users sign in to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) using the same credentials as their on-premises directory environment. With this approach, known as hybrid authentication, users only need to remember one set of credentials. Some organizations haven't moved to hybrid authentication for the following reasons: By default, the Azure AD User Principal Name (UPN) is set to the same value as the on-premises UPN. Changing the Azure AD UPN creates a mismatch between on-premises and Azure AD environments that could cause problems with certain applications and services. Due to business or compliance reasons, the organization doesn't want to use the on-premises UPN to sign in to Azure AD. To help with the move to hybrid authentication, you can configure Azure AD to let users sign in with their email as an alternate login ID. For example, if Contoso rebranded to Fabrikam, rather than continuing to sign in with the legacy ana@contoso.com UPN, email as an alternate login ID can be used. To access an application or service, users would sign in to Azure AD using their non-UPN email, such as ana@fabrikam.com. This article shows you how to enable and use email as an alternate login ID. Before you begin Here's what you need to know about email as an alternate login ID: The feature is available in Azure AD Free edition and higher. The feature enables sign-in with ProxyAddresses, in addition to UPN, for cloud-authenticated Azure AD users. More on how this applies to Azure AD B2B scenarios in the B2B section.

This capability will enable further provisioning into Azure AD and Office 365. Migrating synchronization platforms isn't a small change. Each step of the process mentioned in this article should be validated against your own environment before you remove Azure AD Connect from staging mode or enable the Azure AD cloud provisioning agent. Prerequisites When you switch from Okta provisioning to Azure AD, you have two choices. You can use either an Azure AD Connect server or Azure AD cloud provisioning. To understand the differences between the two, read the comparison article from Microsoft. Azure AD cloud provisioning will be the most familiar migration path for Okta customers who use Universal or User sync. The cloud provisioning agents are lightweight. They can be installed on or near domain controllers like the Okta directory sync agents. Don't install them on the same server. Use an Azure AD Connect server if your organization needs to take advantage of any of the following technologies when you synchronize users: Device synchronization: Hybrid Azure AD join or Hello for Business Passthrough authentication More than 150,000-object support Support for writeback Note All prerequisites should be taken into consideration when you install Azure AD Connect or Azure AD cloud provisioning. To learn more before you continue with installation, see Prerequisites for Azure AD Connect. Confirm ImmutableID attribute synchronized by Okta ImmutableID is the core attribute used to tie synchronized objects to their on-premises counterparts. Okta takes the Active Directory objectGUID of an on-premises object and converts it to a Base64 encoded string. Then, by default it stamps that string to the ImmutableID field in Azure AD. You can connect to Azure AD PowerShell and examine the current ImmutableID\n", "messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!

Yes! You absolutely can. This is a stark contrast to the past environment for SOLIDWORKS. In the past, SOLIDWORKS was explicitly not supported on virtual machines and there weren't any options to run a SOLIDWORKS product on a web browser either. Imagine that, a world where SOLIDWORKS couldn\u2019t run on a virtual machine or in a web browser. But things have changed. So what\u2019s different now? Let\u2019s take a look back and learn from the past. SOLIDWORKS in the Past The lack of official support stemmed from the limitations of OpenGL. The official position of SOLIDWORKS was \"Virtual environments force SOLIDWORKS, eDrawings and DraftSight to run in Software OpenGL mode resulting in significant graphics performance degradation.\" Software OpenGL forces the software to talk to a graphics driver and not the graphics card directly. But today\u2019s virtual machines are capable of taking advantage of the graphics card, they can access the GPU directly. And this has been further extended to enable CD offerings on the cloud or in your web browser. SOLIDWORKS offers beta versions of the software you can access in a web browser in addition to many of the new 3DEXPERIENCE apps that are full-featured CAD modeling applications on the web. The latest two of these apps are xDesign and xShape which offer the power of SOLIDWORKS CAD on the web browser. This is made possible because of the innovative 3DEXPERIENCE platform which enables next level collaboration and CAD modeling. So when people ask us, \u201cCan I run SOLIDWORKS on a virtual machine,\u201d the answer is now: yes! And there\u2019s even CAD in a web browser with the latest products from SOLIDWORKS. SOLIDWORKS Supported Virtual Environments A list of supported virtual environments is listed on the system requirements for SOLIDWORKS. The complete list is shown below.

Me neither, but perhaps you trudge off to work, boot your computer and start working in a system that is completly dependent on the 10 year old, onsite PDM server\u2026 that also serves as the print server and file server. Our good pal, Lou Gallo of SolidWorks Heard explores an alternative to serving up files from your local PDM vault and shows you, in just a few step, how he set up SolidWorks EPDM on Windows Azure. Deploying EPDM on Windows Azure More and more options for offsite, or cloud, servers are becoming available. Butch Lively, who sent me Lou\u2019s story, handles CAD administration for TDA Aviation, where I saw EPDM functioning on an offsite server. Years ago, they approached Rackspace about deploying EPDM on their servers. They had never done it but where willing to try. TDA has successfully served up files from the cloud ever since. So, maybe you\u2019re wondering how you can deploy or at least test an EPDM setup on the cloud, what works and what doesn\u2019t work. Lou explains: I tested if this SQL service would support all the same features as the on-premises version. After further research, this was more of a service to power database applications and does not support stored procedures and other requirements needed for the vault creation wizard (SA access or db_owner access)\u2026 So despite wanting to use the hosted SQL platform, I had to resort to utilizing a local instance of SQL on a Windows Azure virtual machine. The saving grace to using the Windows Azure VM is that you can literally deploy an instance in about 2 minutes with SQL already installed and setup. Lou goes on to provide a few visuals of the setup and warns that it doesn\u2019t address encryption and you have three months to test it out. You\u2019ll also want to listen to his podcast where he did describing the process. Do you run your EPDM install from the cloud?

If employees have to work with multimedia enabled applications, you can hardly do without it. Or for example, a construction company that wants to deliver the Autodesk AutoCAD, Autodesk Revit and Autodesk InfraWorks CAD applications. Within Microsoft Azure you can easily spin up a GPU powered VM and use it with Windows Virtual Desktop as I will show you step-by-step in this blog. This blog will include the following steps; Azure Subscription Usage + Quotas check Deploy a Windows Virtual Desktop Host pool with GPU powered VMs Installing the GPU driver / extension Configure GPU-accelerated app rendering and frame encoding Test the results Step 1 : Azure Subscription Usage + Quotas check Before you start with the deployment of GPU powered virtual machines within your Azure environment, it is good to check your current Usage and Quotas for your subscription first. This is because every Azure subscription has a quota for Standard NV Family vCPUs (GPU enabled VMs) and a Total Regional vCPUs. It may be possible that you quota is not enough for your planned deployment. Also, keep in mind that the quotas are per region. Therefor it is good to request any increase that is needed in forehand. It can take multiple days to process your request, and it is not always be horned, for example, in the case there is not enough space available in your region. To check your quota, open the Subscriptions blade within the Microsoft Azure portal. Open your subscription and open to the Usage + quotas page. When selecting the Microsoft.Compute provider, you will find your quotas in the first few lines as shown in the screenshot above. Step 2 : Deploy a Windows Virtual Desktop Host pool with GPU powered VMs Second step is to deploy a new Windows Virtual Desktop host pool.

You can create and manage requests in the Azure portal, which is covered in this article. You can also create and manage requests programmatically, using the Azure support ticket REST API, or by using Azure CLI. Note The Azure portal URL is specific to the Azure cloud where your organization is deployed. Azure portal for commercial use is: https://portal.azure.com Azure portal for Germany is: https://portal.microsoftazure.de Azure portal for the United States government is: https://portal.azure.us Azure provides unlimited support for subscription management, which includes billing, quota adjustments, and account transfers. For technical support, you need a support plan. For more information, see Compare support plans. Getting started You can get to Help + support in the Azure portal. It's available from the Azure portal menu, the global header, or the resource menu for a service. Before you can file a support request, you must have appropriate permissions. Azure role-based access control To create a support request, you must have the Owner, Contributor, Support Request Contributor role, or a custom role with Microsoft.Support/*, at the subscription level. To create a support request without a subscription, for example an Azure Active Directory scenario, you must be an Admin. Important If a support request requires investigation into multiple subscriptions, you must have the required access for each subscription involved (Owner, Contributor, Reader, Support Request Contributor, or a custom role with the Microsoft.Support/supportTickets/read permission). Go to Help + support from the global header To start a support request from anywhere in the Azure portal: Select the ? in the global header, then select Help + support. Select Create a support request. Follow the prompts to provide information about your problem. We'll suggest some possible solutions, gather details about the issue, and help you submit and track the support request. Go to Help + support from a resource menu To start a support request in the context of the resource you're currently working with: From the resource menu, in the Support + troubleshooting section, select New Support Request. Follow the prompts to provide us with information about the problem you're having.\n[2]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/ja-jp/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request ---

Upload files Close a support request Reopen a closed request Cancel a support plan Next steps After you create an Azure support request, you can manage it in the Azure portal. You can also create and manage requests programmatically by using the Azure support ticket REST API or Azure CLI. Additionally, you can view your open requests in the Azure mobile app. To manage a support request, you must have the Owner, Contributor, or Support Request Contributor role at the subscription level. To manage a support request that was created without a subscription, you must be an Admin. View support requests View the details and status of support requests by going to Help + support > All support requests. On this page, you can search, filter, and sort support requests. Select a support request to view details, including its severity and any messages associated with the request. Send a message On the All support requests page, select the support request. On the Support Request page, select New message. Enter your message and select Submit. Change the severity level Note The maximum severity level depends on your support plan. On the All support requests page, select the support request. On the Support Request page, select Change. The Azure portal shows one of two screens, depending on whether your request is already assigned to a support engineer: If your request hasn't been assigned, you see a screen like the following. Select a new severity level, then select Change. If your request has been assigned, you see a screen like the following. Select OK, then create a new message to request a change in severity level. Allow collection of advanced diagnostic information When you create a support request, you can select Yes or No in the Advanced diagnostic information section. This option determines whether Azure support can gather diagnostic information such as log files from your Azure resources that can potentially help resolve your issue. Azure support can only access advanced diagnostic information if your case was created through the Azure portal and you've granted permission to allow it.

Azure role assignments limit Azure supports up to 2000 role assignments per subscription. This limit includes role assignments at the subscription, resource group, and resource scopes, but not at the management group scope. If you get the error message \"No more role assignments can be created (code: RoleAssignmentLimitExceeded)\" when you try to assign a role, try to reduce the number of role assignments in the subscription. Note Starting November 2021, the role assignments limit for all Azure subscriptions is being automatically increased from 2000 to 4000. There is no action that you need to take for your subscription. The limit increase will take several months. If you are getting close to this limit, here are some ways that you can reduce the number of role assignments: Add users to groups and assign roles to the groups instead. Combine multiple built-in roles with a custom role. Make common role assignments at a higher scope, such as subscription or management group. If you have Azure AD Premium P2, make role assignments eligible in Azure AD Privileged Identity Management instead of permanently assigned. Add an additional subscription. To get the number of role assignments, you can view the chart on the Access control (IAM) page in the Azure portal. You can also use the following Azure PowerShell commands: Azure PowerShell Copy $scope = \"/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>\"$ras = Get-AzRoleAssignment -Scope $scope | Where-Object {$_.scope.StartsWith( $scope)}$ras.Count Azure role assignments limit for management groups Azure supports up to 500 role assignments per management group. This limit is different than the role assignments limit per subscription. Note\n", "messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!

These best practices are derived from our experience with Azure AD RBAC and the experiences of customers like yourself. We encourage you to also read our detailed security guidance at Securing privileged access for hybrid and cloud deployments in Azure AD. 1. Manage to least privilege When planning your access control strategy, it's a best practice to manage to least privilege. Least privilege means you grant your administrators exactly the permission they need to do their job. There are three aspects to consider when you assign a role to your administrators: a specific set of permissions, over a specific scope, for a specific period of time. Avoid assigning broader roles at broader scopes even if it initially seems more convenient to do so. By limiting roles and scopes, you limit what resources are at risk if the security principal is ever compromised. Azure AD RBAC supports over 65 built-in roles. There are Azure AD roles to manage directory objects like users, groups, and applications, and also to manage Microsoft 365 services like Exchange, SharePoint, and Intune. To better understand Azure AD built-in roles, see Understand roles in Azure Active Directory. If there isn't a built-in role that meets your need, you can create your own custom roles. Finding the right roles Follow these steps to help you find the right role. Sign in to the Azure portal or Azure AD admin center. Select Azure Active Directory > Roles and administrators to see the list of Azure AD roles. Use the Service filter to narrow down the list of roles. Refer to the Azure AD built-in roles documentation.

Terminology Extend and renew assignments Scenarios Managing privileged access Azure AD groups (preview) Invite guest users and assign Azure resource roles in Privileged Identity Management Next steps Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is a service in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) that enables you to manage, control, and monitor access to important resources in your organization. These resources include resources in Azure AD, Azure, and other Microsoft Online Services such as Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Intune. The following video introduces you to important PIM concepts and features. What is Azure Active Directory Privileged Identity Management? Watch on Reasons to use Organizations want to minimize the number of people who have access to secure information or resources, because that reduces the chance of a malicious actor getting access an authorized user inadvertently impacting a sensitive resource However, users still need to carry out privileged operations in Azure AD, Azure, Microsoft 365, or SaaS apps. Organizations can give users just-in-time privileged access to Azure and Azure AD resources and can oversee what those users are doing with their privileged access. License requirements Using this feature requires an Azure AD Premium P2 license. To find the right license for your requirements, see Compare generally available features of Azure AD. For information about licenses for users, see License requirements to use Privileged Identity Management. What does it do? Privileged Identity Management provides time-based and approval-based role activation to mitigate the risks of excessive, unnecessary, or misused access permissions on resources that you care about. Here are some of the key features of Privileged Identity Management: Provide just-in-time privileged access to Azure AD and Azure resources Assign time-bound access to resources using start and end dates Require approval to activate privileged roles Enforce multi-factor authentication to activate any role Use justification to understand why users activate Get notifications when privileged roles are activated Conduct access reviews to ensure users still need roles Download audit history for internal or external audit Prevents removal of the last active Global Administrator and Privileged Role Administrator role assignments What can I do with it?

Cyber-attackers use credential theft attacks to target administrator accounts and other privileged access to try to gain access to sensitive data. For cloud services, prevention and response are the joint responsibilities of the cloud service provider and the customer. For more information about the latest threats to endpoints and the cloud, see the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report. This article can help you develop a roadmap toward closing the gaps between your current plans and the guidance described here. Note Microsoft is committed to the highest levels of trust, transparency, standards conformance, and regulatory compliance. Learn more about how the Microsoft global incident response team mitigates the effects of attacks against cloud services, and how security is built into Microsoft business products and cloud services at Microsoft Trust Center - Security and Microsoft compliance targets at Microsoft Trust Center - Compliance. Traditionally, organizational security was focused on the entry and exit points of a network as the security perimeter. However, SaaS apps and personal devices on the Internet have made this approach less effective. In Azure AD, we replace the network security perimeter with authentication in your organization's identity layer, with users assigned to privileged administrative roles in control. Their access must be protected, whether the environment is on-premises, cloud, or a hybrid. Securing privileged access requires changes to: Processes, administrative practices, and knowledge management Technical components such as host defenses, account protections, and identity management Secure your privileged access in a way that is managed and reported in the Microsoft services you care about. If you have on-premises administrator accounts, see the guidance for on-premises and hybrid privileged access in Active Directory at Securing Privileged Access. Note The guidance in this article refers primarily to features of Azure Active Directory that are included in Azure AD Premium P1 and P2.

These resources include resources in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Azure, and other Microsoft Online Services such as Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Intune. PIM enables you to allow a specific set of actions at a particular scope. Key features include: Provide just-in-time privileged access to resources Assign eligibility for membership or ownership of privileged access groups Assign time-bound access to resources using start and end dates Require approval to activate privileged roles Enforce multifactor authentication to activate any role Use justification to understand why users activate Get notifications when privileged roles are activated Conduct access reviews to ensure users still need roles Download audit history for internal or external audit To gain the most from this deployment plan, it\u2019s important that you get a complete overview of What is Privileged Identity Management. Understand PIM The PIM concepts in this section will help you understand your organization\u2019s privileged identity requirements. What can you manage in PIM Today, you can use PIM with: Azure AD roles \u2013 Sometimes referred to as directory roles, Azure AD roles include built-in and custom roles to manage Azure AD and other Microsoft 365 online services. Azure roles \u2013 The role-based access control (RBAC) roles in Azure that grants access to management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources. Privileged Access Groups \u2013 To set up just-in-time access to member and owner role of an Azure AD security group. Privileged Access Groups not only gives you an alternative way to set up PIM for Azure AD roles and Azure roles, but also allows you to set up PIM for other permissions across Microsoft online services like Intune, Azure Key Vaults, and Azure Information Protection. You can assign the following to these roles or groups: Users- To get just-in-time access to Azure AD roles, Azure roles, and Privileged Access Groups.

Least privilege: By managing to least privilege, organizations grant administrators only the permissions they need to perform their job tasks. This helps reduce the risk of unauthorized access and limits the resources that are at risk if an administrator account is compromised.\n\n2. Just-in-time access: PIM allows organizations to provide users with just-in-time privileged access to resources. This means users only have access to the resources they need for a specific period of time. By limiting access duration, organizations reduce the attack surface and minimize the risk of prolonged unauthorized access.\n\n3. Multi-factor authentication: Enforcing multi-factor authentication for all administrator accounts adds an extra layer of security. Even if an attacker manages to obtain the username and password, they would still need the additional factor (such as a mobile device or biometric authentication) to gain access.\n\n4. Recurring access reviews: Regularly reviewing user access and revoking unneeded permissions helps ensure that users only have access to the resources required for their job roles. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access due to outdated permissions.\n\n5. Limiting Global Administrators: Limiting the number of users with Global Administrator privileges reduces the risk of compromised accounts. By restricting the number of users with such high-level access, organizations can better protect critical resources and minimize the potential impact of a compromised administrator account.\n\n6. Group-based role assignments: Using groups for role assignments and delegating the assignment process to group owners simplifies the administration of role assignments. It allows organizations to centrally manage role assignments and easily update them when needed.\n\n7. Cloud-native accounts: Utilizing cloud-native accounts for Azure AD roles instead of relying on on-premises administrator accounts improves the security posture in the cloud. Cloud-native accounts are designed for cloud environments and offer enhanced security features native to the Azure platform.\n\nBy following these best practices, organizations can strengthen their overall security posture in the cloud and reduce the risk of unauthorized access to resources and data."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is it expensive to add this technology or is it freely available?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is a feature included in Azure AD.

This article explains how to do it. Let\u2019s take an example. You go into the Azure AD Identity Protection blade of the Azure portal and find a risky sign-in event. At this point I\u2019ve assessed that the risk is something I know about and am comfortable with dismissing it. I go ahead and dismiss the event. Now, if another administrator comes along, how can they find out who dismissed the event? The answer lies in the Azure AD audit log. Go to the Azure AD blade within the Azure portal and select the Audit Logs option under the Monitoring section. In the right-hand pane, change the Category to \u201cOther\u201d and the Activity to \u201cAdmin dismisses/resolves/reactivates risk event\u201d. From here you can determine who dismised the event as shown in the screenshot below. And that\u2019s it!

Organizations can enable automated remediation using their risk policies. Organizations should try to close all risk detections that they're presented in a time period your organization is comfortable with. Microsoft recommends closing events quickly, because time matters when working with risk. Remediation All active risk detections contribute to the calculation of a value called user risk level. The user risk level is an indicator (low, medium, high) for the probability that an account has been compromised. As an administrator, you want to get all risk detections closed, so that the affected users are no longer at risk. Some risks detections may be marked by Identity Protection as \"Closed (system)\" because the events were no longer determined to be risky. Administrators have the following options to remediate: Self-remediation with risk policy Manual password reset Dismiss user risk Close individual risk detections manually Remediation framework If the account is confirmed compromised: Select the event or user in the Risky sign-ins or Risky users reports and choose \"Confirm compromised\". If a risk policy or a Conditional Access policy wasn't triggered at part of the risk detection, and the risk wasn't self-remediated, then: Request a password reset. Block the user if you suspect the attacker can reset the password or do multi-factor authentication for the user. Revoke refresh tokens. Disable any devices considered compromised. If using continuous access evaluation, revoke all access tokens. For more information about what happens when confirming compromise, see the section How should I give risk feedback and what happens under the hood?. Self-remediation with risk policy If you allow users to self-remediate, with Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and self-service password reset (SSPR) in your risk policies, they can unblock themselves when risk is detected. These detections are then considered closed. Users must have previously registered for Azure AD MFA and SSPR for use when risk is detected. Some detections may not raise risk to the level where a user self-remediation would be required but administrators should still evaluate these detections. Administrators may determine that extra measures are necessary like blocking access\n[4]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/troubleshooting-identity-protection-faq --- Title: FAQs for Identity Protection in Azure Active Directory ... --- Body: FAQs for Identity Protection in Azure Active Directory | Microsoft Docs Azure Active Directory Identity protection Frequently asked questions Identity Protection in Azure Active Directory FAQ 3 contributors In this article Dismiss user risk known issues Frequently asked questions Dismiss user risk known issues Dismiss user risk in classic Identity Protection sets the actor in the user\u2019s risk history in Identity Protection to Azure AD. Dismiss user risk in Identity Protection sets the actor in the user\u2019s risk history in Identity Protection to <Admin\u2019s name with a hyperlink pointing to user\u2019s blade>. There is a current known issue causing latency in the user risk dismissal flow. If you have a \"User risk policy\", this policy will stop applying to dismissed users within minutes of clicking on \"Dismiss user risk\". However, there are known delays with the UX refreshing the \"Risk state\" of dismissed users. As a workaround, refresh the page on the browser level to see the latest user \"Risk state\". Frequently asked questions Why is a user at risk? If you are an Azure AD Identity Protection customer, go to the risky users view and click on an at-risk user. In the drawer at the bottom, tab \u2018Risk history\u2019 will show all the events that led to a user risk change. To see all risky sign-ins for the user, click on \u2018User\u2019s risky sign-ins\u2019. To see all risk detections for this user, click on \u2018User\u2019s risk detections\u2019. Why was my sign-in blocked but Identity Protection didn't generate a risk detection? Sign-ins can be blocked for several reasons. It is important to note that Identity Protection only generates risk detections when correct credentials are used in the authentication request. If a user uses incorrect credentials, it will not be flagged by Identity Protection since there is not of risk of credential compromise unless a bad actor uses the correct credentials. Some reasons a user can be blocked from signing that will not generate an Identity Protection detection include: The IP can be blocked due to malicious activity from the IP address. The IP blocked message does not differentiate whether the credentials were correct or not. If the IP is blocked and correct credentials are not used, it will not generate an Identity Protection detection Smart Lockout can block the account from signing-in after multiple failed attempts A Conditional Access policy can be enforced that uses conditions other than risk level\n[5]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-risk-feedback --- Title: Provide risk feedback in Azure Active Directory Identity ... --- Body: Provide risk feedback in Azure Active Directory Identity Protection | Microsoft Docs Azure Active Directory Identity protection How To: Give risk feedback in Azure AD Identity Protection Article 08/09/2021 4 minutes to read 2 contributors In this article What is a detection? Why should I give risk feedback to Azure AD\u2019s risk assessments? How does Azure AD use my risk feedback? How should I give risk feedback and what happens under the hood? Next steps Azure AD Identity Protection allows you to give feedback on its risk assessment. The following document lists the scenarios where you would like to give feedback on Azure AD Identity Protection\u2019s risk assessment and how we incorporate it. What is a detection? An Identity Protection detection is an indicator of suspicious activity from an identity risk perspective. These suspicious activities are called risk detections. These identity-based detections can be based on heuristics, machine learning or can come from partner products. These detections are used to determine sign-in risk and user risk, User risk represents the probability an identity is compromised. Sign-in risk represents the probability a sign-in is compromised (for example, the sign-in is not authorized by the identity owner). Why should I give risk feedback to Azure AD\u2019s risk assessments? There are several reasons why you should give Azure AD risk feedback: You found Azure AD\u2019s user or sign-in risk assessment incorrect. For example, a sign-in shown in \u2018Risky sign-ins\u2019 report was benign and all the detections on that sign-in were false positives. You validated that Azure AD\u2019s user or sign-in risk assessment was correct. For example, a sign-in shown in \u2018Risky sign-ins\u2019 report was indeed malicious and you want Azure AD to know that all the detections on that sign-in were true positives. You remediated the risk on that user outside of Azure AD Identity Protection and you want the user\u2019s risk level to be updated. How does Azure AD use my risk feedback? Azure AD uses your feedback to update the risk of the underlying user and/or sign-in and the accuracy of these events. This feedback helps secure the end user. For example, once you confirm a sign-in is compromised, Azure AD immediately increases the user\u2019s risk and sign-in\u2019s aggregate risk (not real-time risk) to High. If this user is included in your user risk policy to force High risk users to securely reset their passwords, the user will automatically remediate itself\n", "messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!

For example, you could use the naming policy to communicate the function of a group, membership, geographic region, or who created the group. You could also use the naming policy to help categorize groups in the address book. You can use the policy to block specific words from being used in group names and aliases. Important Using Azure AD naming policy for Microsoft 365 groups requires that you possess but not necessarily assign an Azure Active Directory Premium P1 license or Azure AD Basic EDU license for each unique user that is a member of one or more Microsoft 365 groups. The naming policy is applied to creating or editing groups created across workloads (for example, Outlook, Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, Exchange, or Planner), even if no editing changes are made. It is applied to both the group name and group alias. If you set up your naming policy in Azure AD and you have an existing Exchange group naming policy, the Azure AD naming policy is enforced in your organization. When group naming policy is configured, the policy will be applied to new Microsoft 365 groups created by end users. Naming policy does not apply to certain directory roles, such as Global Administrator or User Administrator (please see below for the complete list of roles exempted from group naming policy). For existing Microsoft 365 groups, the policy will not immediately apply at the time of configuration. Once group owner edits the group name for these groups, naming policy will be enforced, even if no changes are made. Naming policy features You can enforce naming policy for groups in two different ways: Prefix-suffix naming policy You can define prefixes or suffixes that are then added automatically to enforce a naming convention on your groups (for example, in the group name\n[2]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-naming --- Title: Define your naming convention - Cloud Adoption Framework ... --- Body: Define your naming convention - Cloud Adoption Framework | Microsoft Docs Azure Cloud Adoption Framework Ready Best practices Define your naming convention Article 01/03/2022 6 minutes to read 8 contributors In this article Naming scope Example names for common Azure resource types Example names: General Example names: Networking Example names: Compute and Web Example names: Databases Example names: Storage Example names: AI and machine learning Example names: Analytics and IoT Example names: Integration Next steps An effective naming convention composes resource names from important information about each resource. A good name helps you quickly identify the resource's type, associated workload, deployment environment, and the Azure region hosting it. For example, a public IP resource for a production SharePoint workload in the West US region might be pip-sharepoint-prod-westus-001. Diagram 1: Components of an Azure resource name. Naming scope All Azure resource types have a scope that defines the level that resource names must be unique. A resource must have a unique name within its scope. For example, a virtual network has a resource group scope, which means that there can be only one network named vnet-prod-westus-001 in a given resource group. Other resource groups could have their own virtual network named vnet-prod-westus-001. Subnets are scoped to virtual networks, so each subnet within a virtual network must have a distinct name. Some resource names, such as PaaS services with public endpoints or virtual machine DNS labels, have global scopes, so they must be unique across the entire Azure platform. Diagram 2: Scope levels for Azure resource names. Resource names have length limits. Balancing the context embedded in a name with its scope and length limit is important when you develop your naming conventions. For more information, see Naming rules and restrictions for Azure resources. Recommended naming components When you construct your naming convention, identify the key pieces of information that you want to reflect in a resource name. Different information is relevant for different resource types. The following list provides examples of information that are useful when you construct resource names. Keep the length of naming components short to prevent exceeding resource name length limits.

A naming policy can help you and your users identify the function of the group, membership, geographic region, or who created the group. The naming policy can also help categorize groups in the address book. You can use the policy to block specific words from being used in group names and aliases. The naming policy is applied to groups that are created across all groups workloads (like Outlook, Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, Planner, Yammer, etc.). It gets applied to both the group name and group alias. It also gets applied when a user creates a group and when the group name, alias, description, or avatar is edited for an existing group. Tip A Microsoft 365 group naming policy only applies to Microsoft 365 groups. It doesn't apply to distribution groups created in Exchange Online. To create a naming policy for distribution groups, see Create a distribution group naming policy. The group naming policy consists of the following features: Prefix-Suffix naming policy: You can use prefixes or suffixes to define the naming convention of groups (for example: \"US_My Group_Engineering\"). The prefixes/suffixes can either be fixed strings or user attributes like [Department] that will get substituted based on the user who is creating the group. Custom Blocked Words: You can upload a set of blocked words specific to your organization that would be blocked in groups created by users. (For example: \"CEO, Payroll, HR\"). Licensing requirements Using Azure AD naming policy for Microsoft 365 Groups requires that you possess but not necessarily assign an Azure Active Directory Premium P1 license or Azure AD Basic EDU license for each unique user (including guests) that is a member of one or more Microsoft 365 groups. This is also required for the administrator that creates the groups naming policy. Prefix-Suffix naming policy Prefixes and suffixes can either be fixed strings or user attributes.

Restrictions help guarantee a consistent user experience and provide compatibility with other applications. Common restrictions include not exceeding the character length for a name, not containing special characters, and maintaining uniqueness of names within an object set. Note For limits on the number of items you can define, see Work tracking, process, and project limits. General considerations The length restrictions in this article are measured by the number of Unicode characters permitted. Surrogate characters are composed of two Unicode characters, which count as two characters against the length restriction. For details, see About Unicode and Character Sets. As with other operating system files, ASCII control characters (ASCII 1-31) and surrogate combinations are also not allowed. For general information about the operating system restrictions applied to file names, see Naming Files, Paths, and Namespaces. System reserved names Most names you assign should avoid inclusion of system reserved names. These names correspond to: AUX COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, COM10 CON DefaultCollection LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, LPT9 NUL PRN SERVER, SignalR Web or WEB For more information about reserved names, see File Names, Paths, and Namespaces.

These best practices will help you create an effective Microsoft 365 Groups naming policy. If there\u2019s one rule that all organizations moving to the cloud should remember, it\u2019s this: Microsoft 365 isn\u2019t a cloud-based version of a traditional IT environment. Learning how to manage and get the most out of Microsoft 365 is as important\u2014and often as difficult\u2014as migration itself. And because users can, by default, create new groups without going through IT, Microsoft 365 Groups poses its own unique set of governance challenges. An effective cross-product governance strategy can help your tenant stay organized and secure. And a clearly defined Microsoft 365 Groups naming convention is one of the easiest ways to ease anxiety. Table of contents How to create a Microsoft 365/Office 365 Groups naming convention Microsoft 365/Office 365 Groups provisioning IT governance: a multi-step process How to create a Microsoft 365/Office 365 Group: a mini refresher For newcomers, it can be quite difficult to understand what a Microsoft 365 Group is. Unlike a Teams chat or a SharePoint site, it\u2019s not a physical function or feature that users interact with. A Microsoft 365 Group creates individual workspaces within applications across your Microsoft 365 environment. And once a group is created, it\u2019s stored in your Azure Active Directory. These include: An Exchange mailbox A group calendar An Outlook email address A OneDrive file folder A Teams chat channel A SharePoint site collection At the same time, when a workspace is created in any one of these applications, a Microsoft 365 Group is created by default\u2014meaning it\u2019s easy for end users to provision groups accidentally. Before you know it, the number of groups in your tenant have spiralled out of control: the dreaded data sprawl. Microsoft 365 Groups is not a product, nor does it compete with any of the others. It\u2019s actually similar to a security group, but with a provisioning robot and a sense of centralized management.

Currently, I have the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) and Azure Monitoring Agent (AMA) extension installed. I'm wondering how if at all possible it would be to light up MDE and ASC without being double billed. The reason why I ask is that there are three different Log Analytics Workspaces, one for MDE, one for ASC (default), and my Azure made one. Typo: Azure Defender Center -> Azure Security Center. 3 comments 78% Upvoted Log in or sign up to leave a comment Log In Sign Up Sort by: best level 1 thalpius \u00b7 8 mo. ago Azure Defender Center doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s Azure Security Center \u263a\ufe0f When you enable Azure Defender, the plan is enabled per server if you check the \u201cAzure Defender for Servers\u201d. So you can\u2019t be charged twice because of multiple agents being installed. It\u2019s per server. I\u2019m not sure if MDE will be automatically installed on Windows 2012 R2 though. If not, you can use the onboarding method in the MDE portal or Microsoft 365 Defender portal if you have the integration between the two enabled. 2 level 2 IntelligentCanary902 Op \u00b7 8 mo. ago \u00b7 edited 8 mo. ago Sorry yes, that is correct I was talking about Azure Security Center (ASC) thanks for the correction.

Back to Blog Newer Article Older Article What's the difference between Azure Security Center, Azure Defender and Azure Sentinel? By Sonia Cuff Published Feb 22 2021 02:22 AM 80.7K Views It's common to have a pre-defined perspective when you hear the word \"security\". Some people think of applications being configured correctly or insecure coding practices. Some people think of identity concepts like password spray attacks, phishing or multi factor authentication. And some people think of infrastructure concepts like networking, VPNs and port scanning. Security is all of these - and more. Microsoft helps you manage a layered approach to security with tools that integrate with your Azure and non-Azure workloads. Three common capabilities that are used in unison are Azure Security Center, Azure Defender and Azure Sentinel. So what's the difference between them and when would you use each product? NOTE: At Microsoft Ignite November 2021, Microsoft announced a range of security products were being renamed. While the functionality remains mostly the same, see the updated Azure Security product names here. Azure Security Center - Security Posture Management This is your \"base layer\" for monitoring the security configuration and health of your workloads. Azure Security Center collects events from Azure or log analytics agents and correlates them in a security analytics engine, to provide you with tailored recommendations (hardening tasks). Strengthening your security posture can be achieved by implementing these recommendations. The Azure Security Center uses a built-in Azure Policy initiative in audit-only mode (the Azure Security Benchmark) as well as Azure Monitor logs and other Azure security solutions like Microsoft Cloud App Security. The free pricing tier of the Azure Security Center is enabled by default on all Azure subscriptions, once you visit the Azure Security Center in the portal for the first time (or activate it via the API). Then it will automatically discover and onboard Azure resources, including PaaS services in Azure (Service Fabric, SQL Database etc). And you can include non-Azure resources via the Log Analytics agent and Azure Arc. Azure Security Center also includes a network map - an interactive graphical view of the network topology of your Azure workloads and the traffic routes. By default, the topology map displays resources\n[3]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/integration-defender-for-endpoint --- Title: Using the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint license included ... --- Body: Using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint in Microsoft Defender for Cloud to protect native, on-premises, and AWS machines. | Microsoft Docs Azure Security Microsoft Defender for Cloud Protect your endpoints with Defender for Cloud's integrated EDR solution: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Article 04/12/2022 12 minutes to read 8 contributors In this article Availability Benefits of integrating Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with Defender for Cloud What are the requirements for the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint tenant?

What\u2019s the difference between Azure ATP, O365 ATP, and Defender ATP? by JoeGuarini | Sep 16, 2020 | Cloud, Security With the various flavors of Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) that Microsoft offers, it\u2019s important to know their features to understand how each one matches your business\u2019 security needs. Let\u2019s look at the benefits of Azure ATP, Office 365 ATP, and Microsoft Defender ATP to know the difference between them. Azure ATP Azure ATP is focused primarily on identity security, protecting your on-premises Active Directory (AD) users. It is designed to become familiar with user behavior and activities in order to be able to identify malicious activities that deviate from those norms. In being so accustomed to the original, the counterfeit stands out like a sore thumb. Azure ATP also provides helpful recommend ations to improve configurations for your identities to make user profile compromises that much more challenging. With compromises always on the rise, every improvement is essential. Office 365 ATP Office 365 ATP is aimed at protecting users from malicious activity via messaging platforms. With the Plan 1 license applied, your messages go under the magnifying glass. If you\u2019re sent malicious links or attachments in email or chat, O365 ATP has you protected. Links are masked and attachments are tested for safety. Office 365 ATP also enforces anti-phishing policies . It comes with reporting as well. Microsoft Defender ATP Microsoft Defender ATP is aimed at endpoint detection and response. Windows comes with the Defender product, but Defender ATP takes things to a whole new level. With the Threat & Vulnerability Management dashboard, you obtain visibility into vulnerability and misconfigurations on your systems. The Security Operations dashboard shows you active alerts and suspicious activities that may need action. Defender ATP can detect and respond to attacks by noticing activities that not typical for the device. There\u2019s alert and log correlation technology, and you can also act on threats by isolating machines or quarantining files to block them from your network. It is licensed per-user, but it covers up to 5 concurrent devices for that user. Whether the threat comes from an email, a brute force login attempt, or PC malware, there\u2019s an ATP solution to address it.

ATP is the term Advanced Threat Protection's abbreviation. But why there are three different types ATPs from Microsoft and what the difference among them, which one I should pick for my business? Here are some summarized information I found from Internet. Azure ATP https://portal.atp.azure.com/ You will need to activate your ATP with a sensor installation to access your portal. Azure Advanced Threat Protection (Azure ATP) helps to detect and investigate advanced attacks and insider threats across on-premises, Cloud, and hybrid environments, stopping attackers from gaining access to your system. By taking information from multiple data sources, like the logs and events in your network, Azure ATP learns the behavior of your users and other entities within your organization and builds a behavioral profile about them. Then, when suspicious activity is detected, it alerts you via the Azure ATP workspace portal, so you can see those suspicious activities and confirm whether it is a potential attack or not. Source Focusing on Identity Protection with following threats: Reconnaissance Lateral Movement Domain Dominance Azure Advanced Threat Protection is available as part of the Enterprise Mobility + Security E5 bundle, the Microsoft 365 E5 bundle, or as a stand-alone SKU for $5.50 per user per month. Windows Defender ATP https://securitycenter.windows.com/ Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP) integrates with Azure ATP to detect and protect against malicious activity, but its focus is on the end points \u2013 the actual devices being used.

As one of the fastest growing Azure Networking products it is therefore natural that many customers want to trial and test these services within a lab scenario, prior to deployment in production. In addition to this many individuals on learning tracks such as Exam AZ-700: Designing and Implementing Microsoft Azure Networking Solutions wish to get hands on experience to compliment their theoretical reading. In these scenarios, simply leaving the Azure Firewall turned on 24/7 whilst labbing can be cost prohibitive. Azure Firewall Pricing page Azure Firewall standard SKU - ~\u00a322 per day Azure Firewall premium SKU - ~\u00a331 per day These costs are the same if the Firewall is deployed either inside, or outside of a Virtual Wan Hub. Stop/Start Azure Firewall Luckily ARM exposes the required API to effectively pause your underlying Azure Firewall nodes. This in effect stops you paying for the underlying compute resources when you don't need to use them, for example when you are sleeping at night and not learning with your lab! I.e. You can treat your Azure Firewall like you would treat a lab IaaS Virtual Machine. Azure Firewall in customer-manged VNet Official MS doc location here. I make heavy use of this myself, building complex topologies that utilise Azure Firewall, and then simply shutting down my instances when not in use. To make this super simple, I package the allocation and deallocation commands as scripts, hosted in my Azure Cloud Shell directory. Let's take a look at the user experience; I login to the portal and wish to utilise my Azure Firewall, notice how the resource itself does not have any IPs allocated or even an assignment to a virtual network. This is my Azure Firewall in a dormant deallocated state. You are not paying for Azure Firewall node resource costs when your Firewall is deallocated!

In contrary to classic NVA based concepts, there is no need to care about scale and throughput because all of this is managed by Azure in the background. I always recommend it to customers, unless there are specific killer reasons to still use NVA based firewalls. As you might know, deploying highly available NVA solutions hurts big time, because you need load balancers on both, the internal and external NVA interface. If you want to know more about the differences between NVAs and Azure Firewall I\u2019d recommend the following articles: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-firewall-and-network-virtual-appliances/ http://aidanfinn.azurewebsites.net/?p=21469 Saving costs for Dev/Test Environments Azure Firewall is not for free, of course. It can hurt your budget for test and development environments, even if you have zero amount of network traffic. Although a comparable setup with 2 NVAs may cost even more, depending on the VM size and the additional product license, it would be nice to save costs for the Azure Firewall for \u201coff-use\u201d times, right? To save money I\u2019ve created a PowerShell script, which can stop (deallocate) and start an Azure Firewall instance. The script is based on the methods described in the following docs article. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/firewall-faq Using the script has the following advantages: It saves Firewall Information prior to the stop action (information is saved to a custom tag on the object). You\u2019ll need the info when starting the instance again. The script reads it from the tag Scenarios with multiple attached public IP addresses Note: Stopping / deallocating the firewall goes pretty fast. However starting the instance takes as long as spinning up a new instance. (I\u2019m pretty sure this is what happens behind the scenes) You can find the source code on my GitHub here.\n[3]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/questions/456203/subscription-disabled-unable-to-delete-azure-firew.html --- Title: \ue000Subscription\ue001 Disabled - Unable to \ue000delete\ue001 \ue000Azure\ue001 Firewall ... --- Body: Subscription Disabled - Unable to delete Azure Firewall - Microsoft Q&A question 0 t-ahlaaj1 asked \u2022 Jun 29 2021 at 3:59 AM|VinhTungLe-3234 edited \u2022 Mar 30 2022 at 9:20 PM Subscription Disabled - Unable to delete Azure Firewall Hi everyone, I have a free visual studio MSDN subscription, with $115/month credit.

Billing requests do not require a support plan, and you should be able to work with someone to get the subscription temporarily re-enabled so you can delete the resources / cancel the subscription. If for some reason you are unable to create the support request, please let me know and I can make sure one gets opened on that subscription.

One of those services is Azure Front Door, which has been updated and comes with two new products (Standard and Premium) at the preview stage. The other service is Azure Firewall, which now has a Premium offering at the preview stage. Microsoft talked about both products in a Feb. 18 Web presentation, \"Modernize Your Network Security Strategy,\" which was said to be available on demand at this link. The \"Modernize Your Network Security Strategy\" presentation was led by Ann Johnson, Microsoft's corporate vice president of security, compliance and identity for business development. The event included other Microsoft luminaries. Mostly, the speakers highlighted the conceptual aspects of the two products. There was also a thematic emphasis on the overall need for organizations to establish \"zero-trust\" security operations. Azure Front Door Previews Microsoft first introduced Azure Front Door more than two years ago at its Ignite conference as a security solution for overseeing global microservice-based Web applications. A more current definition, posted this week, described it as a secure cloud content delivery network (CDN) service for protecting apps and Web sites: Azure Front Door is a secure cloud CDN service that cyber security teams can use to accelerate content delivery while protecting apps, APIs, and websites from cyberthreats. It combines intelligent threat protection and modern CDN technology in a tightly integrated service that's easy to setup, deploy and manage. Microsoft explained in its Azure Front Door announcement that the Internet has scalable support for applications but it \"has little cybersecurity protections in place\" to secure those apps. In response, Microsoft is adding two products to its Azure Front Door service, namely Standard and Premium (at preview). These new Azure Front Door products combine the \"capabilities of Azure Front Door, Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) standard, and Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) into a single secure cloud CDN platform with intelligent threat protection and a simple to understand pricing model.\" The pricing model consists of a fixed monthly fee, inbound and outbound data transfer costs, and costs based on \"requests per seconds.\" Differences between the two new Azure Front Door products in preview\n[5]: URL: https://infoq.com/news/2019/06/azure-application-gateway-waf --- Title: Benefits of Microsoft\u2019s New Versions of Azure Application ... --- Body: Benefits of Microsoft\u2019s New Versions of Azure Application Gateway and the Web Application Firewall InfoQ Homepage News Benefits of Microsoft\u2019s New Versions of Azure Application Gateway and the Web Application Firewall Cloud Benefits of Microsoft\u2019s New Versions of Azure Application Gateway and the Web Application Firewall Discuss Jun 27, 2019 2 min read by Steef-Jan Wiggers In a recent blog post, Microsoft discusses the benefits of the generally available releases of Azure Application Gateway V2 Standard SKU and Web Application Firewall (WAF) V2 SKU's. Microsoft fully supports them with a 99.95% SLA, significant improvements and capabilities. Azure Application Gateway is part of the Microsoft Azure networking services portfolio that includes Azure Load Balancer, Azure Traffic Manager, and Azure Front Door. The service is a web traffic load balancer and Application Delivery Controller (ADC) in Azure that enables customers to manage traffic to their web applications. The service provides customers with layer 7 load balancing, security and WAF functionality. Next, the Web Application Firewall is integrated with the Azure Application Gateway core offerings and further strengthens the security portfolio and posture of applications - protecting them from many of the most common web vulnerabilities, as identified by Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) top 10 weaknesses. In April, Microsoft announced the release of both Azure Application Gateway V2 and Web Application Firewall (WAF) V2. Subra Sarma, principal program manager, Microsoft Azure, states in the blog that customers should move forward to the V2 SKU\u2019s: We highly recommend that customers use the V2 SKUs instead of the V1 SKU for new applications/workloads. To help customers with migrating to V2 gateways with the same configuration, Microsoft created a PowerShell script along with documentation that helps replicate the settings on a V1 gateway to a new V2 gateway. With the new V2 releases, customers can benefit from: Autoscaling - allowing elasticity for their applications by scaling the application gateway as needed based on the application\u2019s traffic pattern. Zone redundancy - enabling their application gateway to survive zonal failures and offering better resilience. The Static VIP feature ensuring that their endpoint addresses will not change over its lifecycleHeader Rewrite - allowing them to add, remove or update HTTP request and response headers on their application gateway. Faster provisioning and configuration update time. Improved performance for their application gateway, helping them to reduce overall costs.

For other hosting options, see the hosting plan article. An App Service plan defines a set of compute resources for an app to run. These compute resources are analogous to the server farm in conventional hosting. One or more function apps can be configured to run on the same computing resources (App Service plan) as other App Service apps, such as web apps. These plans include Basic, Standard, Premium, and Isolated SKUs. For details about how the App Service plan works, see the Azure App Service plans in-depth overview. Consider an App Service plan in the following situations: You have existing, underutilized VMs that are already running other App Service instances. You want to provide a custom image on which to run your functions. Billing You pay for function apps in an App Service Plan as you would for other App Service resources. This differs from Azure Functions Consumption plan or Premium plan hosting, which have consumption-based cost components. You are billed only for the plan, regardless of how many function apps or web apps run in the plan. To learn more, see the App Service pricing page. Always On If you run on an App Service plan, you should enable the Always on setting so that your function app runs correctly. On an App Service plan, the functions runtime goes idle after a few minutes of inactivity, so only HTTP triggers will \"wake up\" your functions. The Always on setting is available only on an App Service plan. On a Consumption plan, the platform activates function apps automatically. Even with Always On enabled, the execution timeout for individual functions is controlled by the functionTimeout setting in the host.json project file. Scaling Using an App Service plan, you can manually scale out by adding more VM instances. You can also enable autoscale, though autoscale will be slower than the elastic scale of the Premium plan. For more information, see Scale instance count manually or automatically. You can also scale up by choosing a different App Service plan. For more information, see Scale up an app\n[2]: URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63410391/azure-functions-always-on-and-http-triggers --- Title: Azure Functions - Always On and HTTP Triggers - Stack Overflow --- Body: Azure Functions - Always On and HTTP Triggers - Stack Overflow Azure Functions - Always On and HTTP Triggers Ask Question 2 I am currently looking into occasional slow responses after periods of inactivity for an Azure Function application. The Azure Function runs on a dedicated plan, with host runtime version 1.x, and always on enabled. The application uses queue messages to trigger the functions. I noticed the documentation states If you run on an App Service plan, you should enable the Always on setting so that your function app runs correctly. On an App Service plan, the functions runtime goes idle after a few minutes of inactivity, so only HTTP triggers will \"wake up\" your functions. I know that always on sends requests from the front-end load balancer to the application root url, however does that mean I have a http triggered function listening at the root url to ensure the function is always on. I tried this in my local development environment with a function which just returns an OK result and it seems to work. But is it necessary? I would have thought not, as it was based on the web jobs host which just required the application pool to be not idle. Any clarification would be extremely helpful. azure azure-functions azure-functions-runtime Share Improve this question asked Aug 14, 2020 at 9:43 nemstr 33 4 Very interesting question! I've been looking info and I didn't find anything. Maybe can you turn the Always On and see if it stops being cold on without any http trigger function!! \u2013 Nacho Mart\u00ednez-Aedo Aug 14, 2020 at 10:40 This is mostly speculation on my behalf as I haven't really looked much into it. I would imagine that one of the host admin endpoints is called to enable always on functionality. \u2013 Tom Biddulph Aug 14, 2020 at 16:05 Add a comment 1 Answer Sorted by: 1 It would appear that the always on functionality is implemented through the use of a rewrite in the web.config of the function host. A call to the application root url will be forwarded to /admin/host/ping which is part of the host controller. So in answer to your question ..does that mean I have a http triggered function listening at the root url to ensure the function is always on. The answer is no.

If I'm using Always On, I feel I should rightly expect that any update will be loaded and ready to go immediately after it is deployed, so that the responsiveness of Azure Functions remains optimal. It's so bad that I've considered writing my own logic to invoke an endpoint after I update just so that the package is truly deployed and made ready, but that isn't work I should have to do myself with Azure Functions that are using an App Service Plan that supports Always On. This, in my mind, is a design issue with Azure Functions that should be corrected. If my Azure Function endpoints are not busy for a period of time (not sure how long, but I've noticed this after they are idle for a bit), and then I invoke one of the Azure Functions, it takes longer than it does when it is \"hot\". Yet this Azure Function package is supposed to be Always On, which means it should always be \"hot\", should it not? The current behavior makes me feel like the package still enters a cold state from time to time and has to be warmed back up again, which again is contradictory to how Always On is supposed to function. Last I checked, slots were still in preview, not supported, which made me hesitant to use them. Has that changed? Regarding the number of dependencies, I wouldn't say there are a lot. 5 of the DLL dependencies added were included to work around this not being available yet. Other than that the PS 5 reference assemblies and Newtonsoft.Json NuGet packages were referenced. I think the big issue with the \"luke-warm\" start though is in this case PowerShell was being invoked from the Azure function runtime, and with that invocation you would have a lot of dlls loaded into memory as Azure PowerShell modules or AWS modules were loaded into the PowerShell session. Subsequent invocations would have those binaries loaded already, so they would run much faster.\n[4]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/questions/129584/how-can-i-keep-azure-web-app-always-on-during-a-ce.html --- Title: How can I keep Azure web app always on during a certain ... --- Body: How can I keep Azure web app always on during a certain time of the day - Microsoft Q&A question 0 savemightlife-5823 asked \u2022 Oct 16 2020 at 11:49 PM|sadomovalex answered \u2022 Oct 19 2020 at 8:13 AM How can I keep Azure web app always on during a certain time of the day Hi, How can I turn on the ALWAYS ON option in Azure web app. However, I only need it to be ALWAYS ON from 11am-11pm.

For Always On feature of Azure App Service, keeps the host process running. This allows your site to be more responsive to request after significant idle periods. Otherwise, once a request comes in, the App Service will have to cold boot and load into memory before responding to the request. Always On: Keeps the app loaded even when there's no traffic and It's required for continuous WebJobs or for WebJobs that are triggered using a CRON expression. To add to it this means your app stays loaded in memory, vs being aged out (which prevents long delays when a user first visits after the app's cache has expired). It's not related to the allocated Web App resources being deployed. In Basic and Standard service plans, you can turn on the Always On setting to keep the app always loaded. To change the Always On setting: In the Azure portal, go to your web app. Select Configuration. Select General settings. For Always On, select On. Also, could you please elaborate on what is your idea behind scheduling Always On for a certain time of the day to help you better on this.

The HTTP Triggered function can sometimes take over 1-2 hours to complete. I understand that this probably isn't the best design and according to the Azure Function Best Practices I should break this out into smaller / more manageable pieces - I get that. However, I expect the Function on the App Service plan to work as advertised - no hard limit on execution time. Perhaps this is the same question as Unexpected azure-function timeouts on app-service-plan, but that has no answer and I am using an HTTP Trigger instead. Currently, the HTTP Triggered method does not return until the work is complete. (Is this a problem - the HTTP trigger needs to return quicker?) According to the Kudu Function Invocation Logs, this case reports \"Never Finished\", and when I click on the Toggle Output button to view the logs, they never come in. When I viewed this function's run in the Logs section of that trigger, it seems like the function just stopped, and the log stream just reports no new trace: 2017-07-26T16:36:43.116 [INFO] [Class1] Update operation started processing 790 sales records ... 2017-07-26T16:36:43.116 [DBUG] [Class2] Matching and updating ids from the map... 2017-07-26T16:38:07 No new trace in the past 1 min(s). 2017-07-26T16:39:07 No new trace in the past 2 min(s). 2017-07-26T16:40:07 No new trace in the past 3 min(s). 2017-07-26T16:41:07 No new trace in the past 4 min(s). So not sure why this function just seemed to stop - or perhaps it stopped collecting log statements (there are many), and for some reason, the function never completed. Any ideas? Approx time: 2017-07-26T16:00:00 UTC InvocationID: d856c107-f1ee-455a-892b-ed970dcad128 (I think?) If it is indeed being timed out, is there any way for us to know, (Exception?

Bastion FAQ Next steps Azure Bastion is a service you deploy that lets you connect to a virtual machine using your browser and the Azure portal. The Azure Bastion service is a fully platform-managed PaaS service that you provision inside your virtual network. It provides secure and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to your virtual machines directly from the Azure portal over TLS. When you connect via Azure Bastion, your virtual machines don't need a public IP address, agent, or special client software. Bastion provides secure RDP and SSH connectivity to all of the VMs in the virtual network in which it is provisioned. Using Azure Bastion protects your virtual machines from exposing RDP/SSH ports to the outside world, while still providing secure access using RDP/SSH. Key benefits Benefit Description RDP and SSH through the Azure portal You can get to the RDP and SSH session directly in the Azure portal using a single-click seamless experience. Remote Session over TLS and firewall traversal for RDP/SSH Azure Bastion uses an HTML5 based web client that is automatically streamed to your local device. Your RDP/SSH session is over TLS on port 443. This enables the traffic to traverse firewalls more securely. No Public IP address required on the Azure VM Azure Bastion opens the RDP/SSH connection to your Azure VM by using the private IP address on your VM. You don't need a public IP address on your virtual machine. No hassle of managing Network Security Groups (NSGs) You don't need to apply any NSGs to the Azure Bastion subnet. Because Azure Bastion connects to your virtual machines over private IP, you can configure your NSGs to allow RDP/SSH from Azure Bastion only. This removes the hassle of managing NSGs each time you need to securely connect to your virtual machines. For more information about NSGs, see Network Security Groups. No need to manage a separate bastion host on a VM Azure Bastion is a fully managed platform PaaS service from Azure that is hardened internally to provide you secure RDP/SSH connectivity.

In particular, there were claims that it massively overestimated VMware vSphere on-premises costs. At this point in time, however, the TCO calculator has moved out of \u201cPreview\u201d (or at least is no longer labeled as such) and it is now certified by Nucleus Research, which states that the Azure TCO calculator offers \u201ccalculations that generate a fair assessment of actual value a customer may achieve given the data entered.\u201d So, what is exactly Azure TCO calculator for? The Azure TCO calculator may not be perfect, but it appears to be reasonable As with most tools of this nature, the should not be taken as an exact statement of the total cost of ownership of your Azure services, but current feedback is that it does give a reasonable estimation of what you can expect to pay to use Microsoft Azure. The Azure TCO calculator starts with an assessment of your current situation You start by inputting details of your current servers, databases, storage and networking. While that sentence is brief, it\u2019s worth noting that the time needed to input this information accurately may be very lengthy. For example, under servers, you (currently) have to give details of: workload, environment, operating system, server number, processes per server, cores per process, RAM (GB), necessary optimization, GPU and whether or not they are Windows Server 2008/2008R2. For databases it\u2019s (currently): source database type, license type, environment, operating system, servers, processes per server, cores per process, RAM (GB), optimization type and whether or not they are SQL Server 2008/2008R2 plus destination service, maximum DB size and maximum concurrent logins. The good news is that the options for storage and network are much more limited. The bad news is that you may need to repeat this process multiple times to accommodate different options in your local set-up. The even worse news is that for some strange reason the Azure TCO calculator lacks the ability to save a session and come back to it later. On the plus side, there\u2019s no sign of sessions timing out either so you can just leave the browser window open, just make sure to keep it open or you may find yourself crying into your coffee at having to input all the data\n[2]: URL: https://kurtsh.com/2018/07/23/info-azure-pricing-calculator-azure-tco-calculator --- Title: INFO: Azure Pricing Calculator & Azure TCO Calculator ... --- Body: INFO: Azure Pricing Calculator & Azure TCO Calculator | Kurt Shintaku's Blog Posted by: kurtsh | July 23, 2018 INFO: Azure Pricing Calculator & Azure TCO Calculator There are two calculators that everyone using Azure should know: Azure Pricing Calculator Estimate your expected monthly bill using our Pricing Calculator, and track your actual account usage and bill at any time using the billing portal.

One consistent conclusion is that weighing the financial considerations of owning and operating a data center or co-located facility versus employing a cloud infrastructure or a cloud service requires detailed and careful analysis. The TCO is often the financial metric that is used to estimate and compare direct and indirect costs of a product or a service. It typically includes the actual costs of procurement, management, maintenance and decommissioning of hardware resources over their useful life (which is typically a 3 or 5 year period). Given the plethora of different hardware configurations available today, it sometimes becomes difficult to know the actual costs and come up with an accurate TCO model that represents the true cost of running your application. Im also hearing from customers that it can be challenging for them to do the right apples-to-apples comparisons between on-premises infrastructure and an infrastructure that is offered as a service. In practice, it is not as simple as just measuring potential hardware expense alongside utility pricing for compute and storage resources (read our TCO Whitepaper ). We have noticed that customers struggle to compare the two models especially when they are trying to compare the TCO of a web application scenario that includes compute, storage, network access, load balancing and all the complements of the architecture. I am very happy to announce the new TCO Calculator for Web Applications. This tool should help anyone with even a base level of familiarity with infrastructure to generate a fact-based apples-to-apples TCO comparison for on-premises and AWS infrastructure. The tool is simple to use and allows you to adjust your assumptions based on your current data center setup. In three easy steps, it provides both a summary and a comprehensive detailed report, with an FAQ that explains assumptions and methods used. In order to provide an objective analysis, the tool uses a combination of data points from analyst research, and analysis of data from hundreds of customers by both AWS and AWS partners. The calculator also\n[4]: URL: https://cloud.netapp.com/blog/azure-vs-aws-pricing-comparing-apples-to-apples-azure-aws-cvo-blg --- Title: \ue000Azure\ue001 \ue000vs\ue001 AWS \ue000Pricing\ue001: Comparing Apples to Apples - NetApp --- Body: Azure vs AWS Pricing: Comparing Apples to Apples Azure Migration Azure vs AWS Pricing: A Quick Comparison September 10, 2020 Topics: Cloud Volumes ONTAP, Data Migration, Elementary Azure and AWS are two excellent options for deploying cloud services, and many organizations use both to enjoy each cloud\u2019s unique feature set.

SQL Server on Azure VM. In this chapter, we will talk about the advantages and disadvantages of each option. The Cloud options The first option is a single Database in the Cloud that can be administered using the Azure Portal or other tools like SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), PowerShell or third party tools. For more information about installing and connecting to an Azure SQL Database, refer to our article Microsoft Azure, our first steps to migrate data. The second option is a Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure. It is like a local SQL Server, but it is a Virtual Machine stored in the Cloud and that is usually controlled using the RDP client. This option is very easy to install and Administer is you already have SQL Server Experience. For more information about VM machines refer to our article How to migrate your database to an Azure Virtual Machine. Getting started Prices First, let\u2019s talk about prices. This article was made on February 2016. It is possible that the prices will change over the time, but it is a good start point. Let\u2019s check a table with some prices (for a complete table of prices review the references). SQL Server on Azure VM Azure SQL Database 1 Cores, 24 USD per month, Web Edition 2 GB Database, 5 DTUs, 5 USD per month. 16 Cores, 95 USD per month, Web Edition. 250 GB Database, 50 DTUs, 75 USD per month. 16 Cores, 1190 USD per month, Standard Edition 500 GB Database, 250 DTUs, 930 USD per month. 16 Cores, 4464 USD per month, Enterprise Edition 1 TB Database, 1750 DTUs, 7000 USD per month. As you can see, the prices depend on different components. The cheapest option is a one CORE VM machine with SQL Server web edition. The price is 24 USD per month and 0.032 USD per hour. By the other hand, the cheapest option for an Azure SQL databases is 5 USD per month. In SQL Server on Azure VMs, the price depends on the number of Cores and the SQL Edition. The more cores, the more expensive it is.

Which Database should I use in my Azure Serverless App? June 18. 2020 3 Comments Posted in: Azure Serverless Cosmos DB Azure SQL If you're building a new application in Azure and want to use a \"serverless\" approach, what should you use as a database? Obviously, one of the key goals of \"serverless\" is to avoid having to manage your own servers, so the classic \"IaaS\" approach of installing a database on a Virtual Machine isn't a good fit. But there are still plenty of great options. I talked about this in my \"Building Serverless Applications in Azure\" course on Pluralsight, but things have moved on a bit since then so I thought it was worth revisiting the topic. As I see it, in Azure there are three main database options to choose between: Relational databases - Azure SQL Database being the most obvious choice here Document database - Azure Cosmos DB is Azure's offering in this space The budget option (or \"poor man's\" database) - You can also use Azure Storage as a primitive database for minimal cost Relational Databases For many (if not most) software developers, relational databases are the most familiar, and they are often our go-to option for storing data. They have the advantage of allowing very flexible queries and joins between related entities (hence the name), but do require the schema to be designed up front, and modifying that schema requires some kind of migration to be performed. Azure offers a choice of relational databases. The main one is Azure SQL Database, which is essentially a fully managed SQL Server in a PaaS offering. But there is also Azure Database for MySQL, Azure Database for MariaDB, and Azure Database for PostgreSQL available if you are more comfortable with working with one of those databases. Azure SQL Database is a great choice for a serverless application if you do decide that a relational database is the right choice for you. It's really easy to create one and there are several pricing tiers to support everything from a very small and cheap test system, all the way up to a powerful large-scale production system. Azure SQL Database makes it really easy to enable key features for production scenarios such as encryption at rest with customer managed keys, backing up (with point-in-time restore), and replication to another region.\n[3]: URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10417546/whats-the-easiest-cheapest-way-to-create-a-cloud-based-sql-database --- Title: What's the easiest/cheapest way to create a cloud-based ... --- Body: What's the easiest/cheapest way to create a cloud-based SQL database? - Stack Overflow What's the easiest/cheapest way to create a cloud-based SQL database? Ask Question 14 I have a website that I've built (hosted on Amazon S3) and it works great. The only problem is that all of the data is static. I'd like to create a SQL database in the cloud that would allow me to store basic text data from users after they submit forms. I'm still a novice web-developer but I've used sqlite3 for several of my Java desktop apps and I'd like to use that SQL knowledge to create this online database. I guess what i'm asking (in my ignorance) is: how can I create a sqlite-type database that is stored in the cloud and that I can query against using javascript? Where do I get started? Is there a service like Amazon AWS or Azure or something where I can create this database and then use some sort of jQuery/Javascript API to query data from it? I don't need a ton of storage space and my queries would be very basic SQL type stuff. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

CouchDB can host your website, and provides a HTTP API for storing data, to which your client-side JavaScript can make REST calls.

Read A note on node size from this blog. You can list the VM size and price on the Azure sales site. Currently, the cheapest is Standard_B2s with 4 GB RAM.

This one is $3.80/month for Linux and $10.22/month for Windows For whatever reason you can't do this in Terraform yet. Step 1: Click on vmss -> settings -> size -> see all sizes (in small print) -> resize Step 2: Click on vmss -> settings -> instance -> _0 -> upgrade (at top controller bar) I wouldn't worry about the vm instance size too much.

I have an iPhone app that must use external cloud db to sync data between users. Data is structured, so BLOB storage will not do. So far the only alternatives that i see are Amazon SimpleDB MS Azure Storage (Tables). I didnt get if i could use just Storage and no Azure instances.

Storage costs $0.15 / GB $0.11 or less / GB depending on quantity, and you'll pay for bandwidth usage ($0.10 free inbound, $0.15 $0.12 / GB outbound). And you'll pay $0.01 / 10,000 100,000 storage transactions. Regarding Azure tables specifically, you can have as many tables as you'd like within your storage account. Tables are schema-less, with up to 100TB per storage account. You can find more pricing info here. You can sign up for a 90-day trial, including storage, here.

Can user login in Teams web client normally? To narrow this issue, are there any detailed error message in your Teams client? Based on my research, It seems related to Azure AD join and registration service. We suggest you contact your admin to confirm if Mobile Device Management for Office 365 or Microsoft Intune services is enabled. If not, you may let admin login Azure AD admin login Azure AD admin center > Devices > Devices settings to check if \u201cUsers may register their devices with Azure AD\u201d is enabled. https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/allow-my-organization-to-manage-my-device-error/0494a298-4d8c-4046-bcb6-135609f09c1c If the response is helpful, please click \"Accept Answer\" and upvote it.

Can you explain this feature more?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! In Azure Functions, the option to mount a file share allows you to access files stored in an Azure Files share directly from your function code. This means you can read from and write to the file share without needing to manage the storage account directly.\n\nTo use this feature, you need to define a storage connection string and a file share name in the function's configuration. Once the file share is mounted, you can access files using regular file I/O operations in your function code.\n\nMounting a file share offers several advantages. It allows you to easily share data across multiple function apps or even different Azure services. You can also leverage existing file share content in your function code, making it a convenient option for scenarios like log processing or file-based workflows.\n\nDo you have any specific use cases or further questions about Azure Functions and file share mounting?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How do I go about mounting a file share to my Azure Function?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To mount a file share to your Azure Function, you'll need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Create an Azure Files share: First, you'll need to create an Azure Files share in your Azure storage account. This share will act as the file storage location for your function.\n\n2. Obtain the storage connection string: Next, you'll need to obtain the storage connection string for your Azure storage account. You can find this information in the Azure portal by navigating to your storage account, selecting \"Access keys,\" and copying the connection string.\n\n3. Configure the Function App: In the Azure portal, go to your Azure Function App and navigate to the \"Configuration\" section. Add a new application setting with the name \"AzureWebJobsStorage\" and set its value to the storage connection string obtained in the previous step.\n\n4. Configure the file share: In the same \"Configuration\" section, add two new application settings: \"WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE\" with a value of \"0\" and \"AzureFilesConnectionString\" with a value of the connection string for your Azure Files share.\n\n5. Mount the file share in your Function code: Finally, in your Function code, you can access the mounted file share using regular file I/O operations. You can use the provided runtime bindings (e.g., the Input and Output bindings) to interact with the mounted file share.\n\nHope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Are there any specific use cases where mounting a file share to Azure Functions is particularly useful?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, there are several specific use cases where mounting a file share to Azure Functions is particularly useful. \n\nOne common use case is log processing. By mounting a file share, you can easily access log files generated by your applications or services and process them in your Azure Functions. This allows you to analyze, extract insights, or perform aggregations on log data in real-time.\n\nAnother use case is file-based workflows. You can leverage the mounted file share to store input files for your functions and write output files as the result of function processing. This makes it convenient to create workflows that involve file manipulation, such as file transformations, data ingestion, or file storage.\n\nAdditionally, mounting a file share is useful for scenarios where you need to share data or resources across multiple function apps or different Azure services. For example, you can use a mounted file share to store common code libraries, configurations, or input/output files that need to be accessed by multiple function apps or services in your solution.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but the flexibility of mounting a file share in Azure Functions allows for a wide range of use cases. Let me know if you have any specific use case in mind, and I can provide more tailored guidance."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Are there any limitations or considerations I should be aware of when using this feature?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, there are some limitations and considerations to keep in mind when using the feature to mount a file share in Azure Functions:\n\n1. Currently, mounting a file share is only supported in Consumption and Premium plans of Azure Functions. If you're using a different hosting plan, you won't be able to use this feature.\n\n2. The file share mount is read-only, which means you can access and read files from the file share, but you cannot modify or delete files through the mounted file share. If you need to write or delete files, you'll have to use other mechanisms such as Azure Blob storage.\n\n3. There is a timeout limit for the mounting process. If the mount operation takes longer than the timeout period, it could result in a failure. Make sure to monitor and handle mount failures appropriately in your code.\n\n4. Mounting a file share can introduce additional latency compared to local file access within the Azure Function's execution environment. Depending on your specific use case and performance requirements, it's important to consider the potential impact on latency and adjust accordingly.\n\n5.

The focus is hooking up a common and popular firewall product from Fortinet, Inc. with an Azure Log Analytics workspace to gain insight and affect control into the Internet traffic through the firewall. This article is for organizations with syslog-equipped firewalls they would like to manage better, and that already have (or are OK with establishing) an Azure Log Analytics workspace as a destination for their firewall syslog data. Solving a Real Problem with website publishing A recent low disk condition on a web server discovered many gigabytes of \u201cIIS\u201d web logs documenting months of attempts from Internet sources trying to blindly guess their way to higher access. The logs had grown to almost fill the server hard drive. The small location has only web and SMTP published with no commercial traffic, yet just having any web server on the Internet attracts a vast array of scoundrels. Figure 1 \u2013 Typical web hacker/hostile log profile: Different client stacks, from the same foreign IP address, probing for common attack surfaces. Figure 1 shows the IIS logs of a typical hacking or otherwise hostile probe attempt. Here is a legend of what\u2019s happening: The same Internet IP address (in green) sends requests from two \u2018browser\u2019 clients one minute apart (Windows XP in blue, then Ubuntu X11 in orange ). The requests are for well-known exploitable, specific server-side scripts (in red ). (None of these paths existed on the lab server, thus the 404 Not Found code is returned.) The small site where the IIS server is located needs to receive some web traffic from the Internet, as well as the ability to send and receive email, so full Internet isolation is not an option. It just seems a shame to waste so much processing and logging resources on \u2018server spam\u2019. Not to mention the risk of having the exposure of being constantly probed for security lapses. Firewall products and Azure Log Analytics The FortiGate and FortiWifi firewalls from Fortinet, Inc. featured in this solution are popular with small, medium, and large enterprises. Fortinet has its own management toolset named FortiAnalyzer. The management product is extra cost and not included with the firewall product.\n[2]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/questions/9082/achieve-country-level-blocking-while-using-azure-t.html --- Title: Achieve country level blocking while using azure traffic ... --- Body: Achieve country level blocking while using azure traffic manager and azure application gateway with WAF - Microsoft Q&A question 0 AkashSamal-8200 asked \u2022 Feb 17 2020 at 7:13 AM|SnehaAgrawal-MSFT commented \u2022 Jul 20 2020 at 7:05 AM Achieve country level blocking while using azure traffic manager and azure application gateway with WAF We have used azure traffic manager and azure application gateway with a Web application firewall for MVC C# web Application which hosted on the Azure virtual machine.

I realize that isn't foolproof and can easily be bypassed using VPN or proxy, but it will help. I know you can block vnet access by IP, but the list of subnets would be staggeringly large, and still too large if I do it in reverse and block all except native country. In most firewalls there is a simple \"block X countries\" function. I see no such function within Azure for standard traffic to VNET's (though I do see one for web apps). My thought would be to spin up an instance of pFsense or another firewall, and configure my vnet to use it for in/out and do the blocking there.

One of those signals that can be incorporated into the decision-making process is location. Organizations can use this location for common tasks like: Requiring multi-factor authentication for users accessing a service when they're off the corporate network. Blocking access for users accessing a service from specific countries or regions. The location is determined by the public IP address a client provides to Azure Active Directory or GPS coordinates provided by the Microsoft Authenticator app. Conditional Access policies by default apply to all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Named locations Locations are named in the Azure portal under Azure Active Directory > Security > Conditional Access > Named locations. These named network locations may include locations like an organization's headquarters network ranges, VPN network ranges, or ranges that you wish to block. Named locations can be defined by IPv4/IPv6 address ranges or by countries. IP address ranges To define a named location by IPv4/IPv6 address ranges, you'll need to provide: A Name for the location One or more IP ranges Optionally Mark as trusted location Named locations defined by IPv4/IPv6 address ranges are subject to the following limitations: Configure up to 195 named locations Configure up to 2000 IP ranges per named location Both IPv4 and IPv6 ranges are supported Private IP ranges cannot be configured The number of IP addresses contained in a range is limited. Only CIDR masks greater than /8 are allowed when defining an IP range. Trusted locations Administrators can name locations defined by IP address ranges to be trusted named locations. Sign-ins from trusted named locations improve the accuracy of Azure AD Identity Protection's risk calculation, lowering a user's sign-in risk when they authenticate from a location marked as trusted. Additionally, trusted named locations can be targeted in Conditional Access policies. For example, you may restrict multi-factor authentication registration to trusted locations.

This article describes how to program directly against the protocol in your application. When possible, we recommend you use the supported Microsoft Authentication Libraries (MSAL) instead to acquire tokens and call secured web APIs. Also take a look at the sample apps that use MSAL. Warning Microsoft recommends you do not use the ROPC flow. In most scenarios, more secure alternatives are available and recommended. This flow requires a very high degree of trust in the application, and carries risks which are not present in other flows. You should only use this flow when other more secure flows can't be used. Important The Microsoft identity platform only supports ROPC within Azure AD tenants, not personal accounts. This means that you must use a tenant-specific endpoint (https://login.microsoftonline.com/{TenantId_or_Name}) or the organizations endpoint. Personal accounts that are invited to an Azure AD tenant can't use ROPC. Accounts that don't have passwords can't sign in with ROPC, which means features like SMS sign-in, FIDO, and the Authenticator app won't work with that flow. Use a flow other than ROPC if your app or users require these features. If users need to use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to log in to the application, they will be blocked instead. ROPC is not supported in hybrid identity federation scenarios (for example, Azure AD and ADFS used to authenticate on-premises accounts). If users are full-page redirected to an on-premises identity providers, Azure AD is not able to test the username and password against that identity provider. Pass-through authentication is supported with ROPC, however. An exception to a hybrid identity federation scenario would be the following: Home Realm Discovery policy with AllowCloudPasswordValidation set to TRUE will enable ROPC flow to work for federated users when on-premises password is synced to cloud. For more information, see Enable direct ROPC authentication of federated users for legacy applications. Tip Try executing this request and more in Postman -- don't forget to replace tokens and IDs!

Activity Alerts - BAV2ROPC Hello, I have an activity alert set up to email me whenever a log in is detected from one of my 12 office 365 email users. These emails contain the username logging in and the IP address the log in originated from. Until the end of 2019, all IP addresses were expected, either being that of the office, the Vodafone mobile network or the home addresses of the sales guys. In 2020, I have started getting log in alerts, which according to https://whatismyipaddress.com/ are from Microsoft Datacentres in Ireland, Holland and Austria, all with \"Microsoft Corporation\" as the ISP and sometimes with the same for the Organisation and sometimes with \"Microsoft Azure\". e.g 40.101.88.221 (Amsterdam), 40.101.102.149 (Dublin). Worried about potential breaches, I contacted Microsoft Support (who by the way are always ON IT, thank you) who helped me find info in the audit log to say the User Agent is BAV2ROPC, which lead me to this page https://www.reddit.com/r/Office365/comments/bl90gw/bav2ropc_user_agent_in_logs/ where someone's found it means \"Business Apps v2 Resource Owner Password Credential\", which is apparently the User Agent for an updated version of Outlook Mobile.

I have not received texts in relation to these logins, so again I don't think it's a breach. 3) I don't use Microsoft Outlook on my mobile, so don't think I'd be generating this BAV2ROPC user agent (but I am on the Activity Alerts). 4) If it was a device I was using\n[4]: URL: https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2287595-office-365-bav2ropc-sign-in --- Title: Office 365 BAV2ROPC Sign in - Spiceworks --- Body: Office 365 BAV2ROPC Sign in Home Office 365 BAV2ROPC Sign in Posted by CarlosTech on Sep 8th, 2020 at 10:22 AM Needs answer Microsoft Office 365 Microsoft Azure Sup Spiceheads!

This threat is a moving target with techniques and tools always changing, and Microsoft continues to find new ways to detect these types of attacks and help protect its customers. In this blog, we are going to define what password sprays are, detail DART\u2019s investigation techniques and approach to responding to password spray attacks, and outline our recommendations for protecting against them. Why are identity-based attacks suddenly so popular? Previously, threat actors focused on attacking computers to gain access into an environment. As software becomes more intelligent at detecting abnormal programs and vulnerabilities, attacks against our customers are rapidly becoming more focused on breaking into identities rather than breaking into a network. The approach to securing user accounts is well-intentioned, but it is often incomplete, with a large investment that typically goes into areas such as complex password policies and limiting access to resources from networks perceived as secure. While these mitigations are necessary best practices, in the case of a compromised trusted user, they are ineffective at preventing unauthorized access. This is why identity attacks have become so popular. Once attackers have gained the credentials to an account, they can access any sensitive resources that users can access and have the malicious activity appear as normal. This creates a repeating cycle attack pattern, where one compromised account can lead to access to resources where additional credentials can be harvested, and thus even further resource access. Figure 1. Identity-based attack lifecycle. The anatomy of a password spray attack To understand how to protect against, and investigate a password spray attack, it is important to understand what it is. Password spray attacks are authentication attacks that employ a large list of usernames and pair them with common passwords in an attempt to \u201cguess\u201d the correct combination for as many users as possible. These are different from brute-force attacks, which involve attackers using a custom dictionary or wordlist and attempting to attack a small number of user accounts.

Security Risks: Microsoft recommends using more secure authentication flows instead of ROPC whenever possible. The ROPC flow requires a high degree of trust in the application and carries certain security risks that may not be present in other flows. It is important to thoroughly assess the security implications and risks involved before implementing ROPC.\n\n2. Trust and Authorization: The ROPC flow should only be used when more secure alternatives are not feasible or available. It is essential to carefully evaluate the level of trust and authorization required for the application and ensure that appropriate security measures are in place.\n\n3. Limitations and Dependencies: ROPC has certain limitations and dependencies. For example, it is not supported for personal accounts, multi-factor authentication (MFA), or accounts without passwords. If your application or users require these features, it is recommended to use alternative flows. Additionally, ROPC is not supported in hybrid identity federation scenarios.\n\n4. Alternatives: Microsoft recommends using the Microsoft Authentication Libraries (MSAL) instead of directly implementing the ROPC flow. MSAL provides a more secure and recommended approach for acquiring tokens and calling secured web APIs.\n\nBefore proceeding with the implementation of ROPC, it is advisable to thoroughly review the documentation, evaluate the specific requirements of your application, and consider consulting Microsoft Support for further guidance.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can help you with!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "In conclusion to it, want to ask that.

This may include implementing strong security measures, such as strong passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and regular monitoring and auditing of the authentication process.\n\nIt is crucial to follow best practices, stay updated with security recommendations from Microsoft, and regularly review and assess the security of your implementation.

We are continually investing in additional infrastructure and features to make sure that we always have all VM types available to support customer demand. However, you may occasionally experience resource allocation failures because of unprecedented growth in demand for Azure services in specific regions. This problem can occur when you try to create or start VMs in a region while the VMs display the following error code and message: Error code: AllocationFailed or ZonalAllocationFailed Error message: \"Allocation failed. We do not have sufficient capacity for the requested VM size in this region. Read more about improving likelihood of allocation success at https://aka.ms/allocation-guidance\" Note If you are troubleshooting a virtual machine scale set (VMSS), the process is the same as a standard VM.

Forbes says that Microsoft Azure is set to boost the size of the IT market by $10 trillion in the next 10 years! But what is Azure? It is just another set of cloud services that is used to construct, establish, and manage applications through Microsoft\u2019s globally distributed network of data centers. It\u2019s an elastic platform, that can be used to run applications on the cloud or simply improve the current applications with cloud capabilities.

One of the reasons why I consider choosing Blob Storage over SP Document Libraries is because I use PowerApps. PowerApps can interact with Data from both Blob Storage and SP. But if you are using the PowerApp to interact with a SP list, you can only manage up to 2500 items in your SP list. That is very limiting in a business environment where you are quick to exceed these 2500 items. With Blob Storage a limit of that kind does not exist. Thank you and best regards JHL 1 Like Reply Jay_Calderwood replied to telecaster \u200eMay 29 2020 06:32 AM @telecaster If your customer rarely accesses these files and these are truly archival documents then, this is where the cool storage comes in. It's a few dollars a month and the files just wait there, waiting to be opened. This is good if they are rarely accessed. Whereas a document library will need some sort of care and love. Documents will need to be split up, organized, etc. It's all also on how the client wants to access the data, will it\n[2]: URL: https://reddit.com/r/azure/comments/a1rpg6/sharepoint_vs_azure_blob_storage --- Title: Sharepoint vs Azure blob storage : AZURE - reddit --- Body: Sharepoint vs Azure blob storage : AZURE 1 Posted by u/OnlyWorkWork 3 years ago Sharepoint vs Azure blob storage Hallo folks At the moment i'm going with the thoughts about moving all my on-prem file storage to the cloud.

Their constraints on me are that it can't have a lot of code development as they do not think they will keep or hire the talent to maintain it once we leave, and it has to be easy to set up as they create new projects\n[5]: URL: https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2231133-sharepoint-vs-azure-files --- Title: Sharepoint vs Azure files - Office 365 - Spiceworks --- Body: Sharepoint vs Azure files - Office 365 Home Cloud Microsoft Office 365 Sharepoint vs Azure files Posted by pedramhaghzaban on Sep 10th, 2019 at 7:05 AM Needs answer Microsoft Office 365 Hi everyone, I know this question might asked before but our situation is little bit different compare to others. Currently our office has a file server and we recently started using 365 and my goal is to completely move to cloud ( we just have a file server and a dc). And by completely I mean using Azure AD instead of current on premise and use either Sharepoint or Azure files to replace the on premise file server. Most of our files are either documents such as excel, word, pdf, and pictures. Currently the total amount of size is 877GB. But it will be smaller that that since some of them are not important or are installation files. One option is Sharepoint but the challenging part was recreating the permissions (It is already done) and download/upload each file when the user is working on them. The advantage of it that I'm seeing is the multi platform which gives users on pretty much any operating system to access the files. It is also part of our subscription which means it is free for now. The other option is Azure Files but to my Knowledge in past couple days that I've been researching, we need a VM for it either on-prem or over the Azure which adds around $338.43 for both Azure storage and a VM. Now my question is which one of these 2 solutions would work better for now and future?

These services are: Azure Event Grid Azure Event Hubs Azure Service Bus Although they have some similarities, each service is designed for particular scenarios. This article describes the differences between these services, and helps you understand which one to choose for your application. In many cases, the messaging services are complementary and can be used together. Event vs. message services There's an important distinction between services that deliver an event and services that deliver a message. Event An event is a lightweight notification of a condition or a state change. The publisher of the event has no expectation about how the event is handled. The consumer of the event decides what to do with the notification. Events can be discrete units or part of a series. Discrete events report state change and are actionable. To take the next step, the consumer only needs to know that something happened. The event data has information about what happened but doesn't have the data that triggered the event. For example, an event notifies consumers that a file was created. It may have general information about the file, but it doesn't have the file itself. Discrete events are ideal for serverless solutions that need to scale. A series of events report a condition and are analyzable. The events are time-ordered and interrelated. The consumer needs the sequenced series of events to analyze what happened. Message A message is raw data produced by a service to be consumed or stored elsewhere. The message contains the data that triggered the message pipeline. The publisher of the message has an expectation about how the consumer handles the message. A contract exists between the two sides. For example, the publisher sends a message with the raw data, and expects the consumer to create a file from that data and send a response when the work is done. Azure Event Grid Event Grid is an eventing backplane that enables event-driven, reactive programming.

With the recent release of the new client libraries for Azure Event Grid, the Azure SDK Team has released new client libraries for three key messaging services on Azure \u2013 the other two being Azure Event Hubs and Azure Service Bus. The libraries all follow the same design guidelines and are available in .NET, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python. This blog post will highlight some of the key improvements in the new libraries. You can find links to all the latest libraries at https://aka.ms/azsdk. Why new client libraries? The new client libraries for messaging services are part of a larger set of new client libraries that we have been releasing for different Azure services since November 2019. We have shared the motivation behind the creation of these new libraries in the following blog posts: Previewing Azure SDKs following new Azure SDK API Standards, and State of the Azure SDK 2021. Messaging services on Azure Although Azure Event Hubs, Azure Service Bus, and Azure Event Grid share some similarities, they are designed for different scenarios. For a detailed comparison of the services, we recommend checking out these articles in the documentation for Azure services: Choose between Azure messaging services \u2013 Event Grid, Event Hubs, and Service Bus Events, Data Points, and Messages \u2013 Choosing the right Azure messaging service for your data Azure Event Hubs SDK Highlights Simpler clients, consistent experience Clients are usually the entry point into a library. This means before users can invoke a method, they have to create an instance of a client first. We have redesigned the client hierarchy of the new libraries to be simpler and more approachable for developers. The new libraries use the same client for all publishing scenarios, with a set of options controlling specific behaviors rather than having different clients for each scenario. This design, along with having similar names, signatures, and location for the methods provide a consistent experience for publishing. Please see our Migration Guides for a more detailed comparison of the client hierarchy in the latest library and that of the previous library.

Queues care more about making sure that every message gets processed. Event Hubs cares about ordering and throughput, but Queues can also get in each others way. This blog will show that choosing the wrong messaging pipeline can result in a difference in the processing time of the messages sent to serverless pipelines. The big question is: \u201cHow does my processing pipeline respond to a long task?\u201d Audio Presented by Speed: Read by: @jeffhollan Jeff Hollan Senior Program Manager Performance and throughput considerations I have this conversation about twice a week. Someone has decided they want to take advantage of the benefits of serverless Azure Functions for an upcoming project, but when starting to lay out the architecture a question pops up: \u201cShould we be using Azure Event Hubs, Queues, or Event Grid?\u201d It\u2019s honestly a great question \u2014 and it\u2019s a question with consequences. Each of these messaging technologies comes with its own set of behaviors that can impact your solution. In previous blogs, I\u2019ve spent some time explaining Event Grid, Event Hubs ordering guarantees, how to have ordering guarantees in queues / topics, and how to keep Event Hub stream processes resilient. In this blog, I specifically want to tackle one other important aspect: throughput for variable workloads. Here was the scenario I was faced with this last week: We have a solution where we drop in some thousands of records to get processed. Some records only take a few milliseconds to process, and others may take a few minutes. Right now we are pushing the messages to functions via Event Hubs and noticed some significant delays in getting all messages processed. The problem here is subtle, but simple if you understand the behavior of each trigger. If you just have a pile of tasks that need to be completed, you likely want a queue. It\u2019s not a perfect rule, but more often than not queues may have the behavior you are looking for. In fact, this blog will show that choosing the wrong messaging pipeline can result in an order of magnitude difference in processing time.

Can you help me with that?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! Azure Service Bus and Azure Event Hubs are both messaging services in Azure, but they are designed for different scenarios. \n\nAzure Service Bus is a traditional enterprise messaging service that enables reliable message delivery between applications or components. It follows a queue-based or topic-based publish-subscribe model, allowing decoupled and asynchronous communication between producers and consumers. Service Bus guarantees message delivery and supports features like FIFO (First-In-First-Out) ordering, transactional messaging, and dead-lettering. It is typically used for scenarios like order processing, financial transactions, and enterprise messaging [[1]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/compare-messaging-services) [[3]](https://azuretrendz.wordpress.com/2020/05/15/event-hub-vs-event-grid-vs-service-bus).\n\nOn the other hand, Azure Event Hubs is a big data streaming platform that is built to handle large volumes of streaming data from multiple sources. It is designed for high-throughput ingestion and real-time analytics of telemetry data, logs, or other time-sensitive data. Event Hubs uses a partitioning model to distribute data across multiple partitions and allows consumers to read data from specific partitions. It provides features like time-based retention, replay, and integration with Azure Storage, Azure Functions, and Azure Stream Analytics. Event Hubs is commonly used in IoT telemetry, clickstream analysis, and streaming analytics scenarios [[1]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/compare-messaging-services) [[3]](https://azuretrendz.wordpress.com/2020/05/15/event-hub-vs-event-grid-vs-service-bus).\n\nIn summary, Azure Service Bus is well-suited for traditional message-based communication between applications, while Azure Event Hubs is designed for high-volume streaming scenarios with real-time analytics requirements."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I mainly want to learn about the scenarios and benefits of each. Can you share some knowledge on that?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! Let's start with Azure Service Bus. It is commonly used in scenarios where reliable message delivery and transactional messaging are important. Here are some examples:\n\n1. Order Processing: Service Bus can be used to implement order processing systems where messages represent orders. The queue-based model ensures that each order is processed in the order it was received, ensuring FIFO (First-In-First-Out) behavior.\n\n2. Financial Transactions: Service Bus supports transactional messaging, making it suitable for handling financial transactions. It guarantees the atomicity and consistency of message processing, ensuring that messages are either fully processed or not processed at all.\n\n3. Enterprise Messaging: Service Bus is often used for communication between different components or applications within an enterprise. It enables decoupling of the sender and receiver, allowing them to work independently and at their own pace.\n\nNow, let's move on to Azure Event Hubs and its scenarios:\n\n1. IoT Telemetry: Event Hubs is designed to handle the high-volume, real-time streaming data generated by IoT devices. It can ingest data from thousands or even millions of devices simultaneously, making it ideal for IoT telemetry scenarios.\n\n2. Clickstream Analysis: Event Hubs is commonly used to capture and analyze clickstream data from web applications. It allows real-time processing and analysis of user interactions and behaviors to gain insights and make data-driven decisions.\n\n3. Streaming Analytics: Event Hubs integrates well with Azure Stream Analytics, which enables complex event processing and analytics on real-time data streams. By combining Event Hubs with Stream Analytics, you can perform actions, aggregations, and transformations on the incoming data in real time.\n\nTo summarize, Azure Service Bus is well-suited for traditional message-based communication and scenarios that require reliable message delivery and transactional messaging. Azure Event Hubs, on the other hand, is designed for high-volume streaming scenarios, such as IoT telemetry and real-time analytics."}, {"role": "user", "content": " Are there any other factors I should consider when choosing between them?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, there are a few other factors you should consider when choosing between Azure Service Bus and Azure Event Hubs:\n\n1. Scale and Throughput: Azure Event Hubs is optimized for handling high throughput and can handle millions of events per second. It is designed to handle high volumes of data streaming from multiple sources. On the other hand, Azure Service Bus is designed for lower volumes of messages and may not have the same level of scalability as Event Hubs. If you require high throughput and scalability, Event Hubs would be a better choice.\n\n2. Ordering and Persistence: Azure Event Hubs maintains the order of events within a partition, allowing consumers to process events in the order they were received. Event Hubs also offers features like time-based retention and the ability to store events in Azure Storage for later analysis. Azure Service Bus guarantees message ordering within a queue, ensuring FIFO behavior. It also provides features like dead-lettering and transactional messaging.\n\n3. Use case requirements: Consider the specific requirements of your use case. If your application relies on real-time streaming and analytics or if you are dealing with high volumes of data, Azure Event Hubs would be a suitable choice. If you need guaranteed message delivery, transactional messaging, or require a traditional enterprise messaging system, Azure Service Bus is a better fit.\n\n4. Integration: Both Azure Service Bus and Azure Event Hubs integrate with other Azure services like Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps, and Azure Stream Analytics.

During this time, it not only received numerous new features but also acquired the new name Microsoft Intune. This aims to show that Intune supports other platforms in addition to Windows. MDM features also available for Office 365 ^ Microsoft calls it one of the tools for \"modern management.\" It encompasses the concept of mobile device management (MDM) for every device type, including PCs running Windows 10. The functions for MDM are not only available via the standalone version of Intune but also are in some Office 365 subscriptions. However, the latter do not offer all features; for example, support for mobile application management (MAM) is missing. Comparison of features between MDM in Office 365 and standalone Intune. Source Microsoft You can find a comparison of the available functions on this Microsoft support page. End of hybrid mode with SCCM ^ Intune is not yet a fully fledged replacement for System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), but it is catching up to the on-prem tool. Since the end of last year, for example, this cloud tool can distribute all Win32 applications. However, it is not able to deploy images of Windows 10; hence an additional cloud service called Autopilot serves for performing this task. Intune can distribute Win32 applications not just as MSI packages The reduced dependence on the Configuration Manager is also evident from the fact that in September 2019, they'll discontinue the hybrid MDM mode, in which\n[2]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/questions/386921/map-network-drive-to-non-domain-joined-computer.html --- Title: Map Network Drive to Non Domain Joined Computer ... --- Body: Map Network Drive to Non Domain Joined Computer - Microsoft Q&A question 0 PrabinBhusal-5638 asked \u2022 May 07 2021 at 4:47 AM|jeevanlal-5428 answered \u2022 Nov 15 2021 at 3:39 PM Map Network Drive to Non Domain Joined Computer Hello, I have a storage account in Azure which is domain joined.

A few years ago, we released our App Lock feature in response to feedback that you wanted to make sure your app was secured by a PIN or biometric. Last month, we expanded App Lock\u2019s protection. Now, if App Lock is enabled, when you approve any notification, you\u2019ll also have to provide your PIN or biometric. With our latest release, as part of our effort to make your sign-in experience even more secure, App Lock will be enabled by default if you\u2019ve set up a PIN or biometric on your device. Try it out If you don\u2019t have the Microsoft Authenticator app yet, get it here. You\u2019ll need to be on version 6.4.22+ on iOS to try this out. We\u2019ve been rolling out this feature to iOS TestFlight starting today, and we\u2019ll be gradually rolling out to all users over the next few weeks. The update will come to Android next month. How different notifications will work Azure AD and MSA MFA notifications Currently, when the notification arrives on the phone, you can click approve/deny from the lock screen. However, when app lock is enabled, you will have to launch the app (on iOS) or launch a dialog (on Android) before you can click approve/deny, and you\u2019ll also need to provide an additional PIN/bio gesture to successfully authenticate. Thus, even if you leave your phone unlocked on your desk and walk away, a passerby cannot approve the notification for you. Enterprise on-premise MFA notifications that already require a PIN The flow will remain as it is today. After you interact with the notification, you will need to provide your MFA pin (not your device pin). In subsequent approvals, you will have the option to use your device bio gesture instead of your MFA pin. Azure AD and MSA Phone sign-in notifications The flow will remain as it is today.

But when we talk about a production grade application and an infrastructure for the same , App service lacks in various perspective. This article highlights all the pros and cons of using App-service for a application hosting and Azure Kubernetes with facts. Following aspects are taken in to account in this article: Deployment and Administration Cost analysis Value addition Deployment and administration: Deploying with the AKS is encapsulated still distributed. Which means all the workload stay inside the cluster and also the work space has a very fine grain separation with Namespaces. So In case of any issues related to workload it is quite easier to spot the bug because the issues lies in the same enclosed areas. However if we deploy in the app services , which is a black box for the developer or end user. Spotting of issue only lies on the logs that we obtain form the log stream which is time taking and tedious . Some times log streams takes time to show the logs. and Sometime it does not show logs. In the same line, if we deployment our Work load with AKS, we can have a upper-hand control of what we want to do in the system, With the help of open-source monitoring tool stack with (prometheus, loki and grafana) , we now have the each and every-log streamed our dash board for the near real time visualization (refresh rate 10s max). And also we can customize our metrics based on our requirement which is not doable by the azure metrics service. The compute resource perspective: App services essentially runs on app service plan. In the current scenario, The Maximum spec for the premium app service i,e lets say P2V2 you will get max of 4 core and the cost is too high, will be discussing the cost part in the cost section. However, if you consider the price of P2V2 with V4 cpu you can build a very powerful AKS cluster which will perform better.

The comparisons are only approximate but representative of the underlying cost structure. Unless there are hard Windows server dependencies, switching to AKS will save 30%+ and AKS is fully supported by Microsoft tools like Visual Studio and Azure DevOps. Cost Comparison between Azure Kubernetes vs. App Services A few other notes and interesting facts uncovered while working on this cost analysis: The discount between Monthly and Dev/Test VM pricing appears to be the license cost of Windows server. Linux VMs pricing is the same as Windows Dev/Test pricing and there is no additional discount. AKS does not support the instance sizes of the smallest App Service Plans. The documentation of the instance sizes used is for the Premium v2 tier. Only the Premium Tier of App Service Plans has SSD storage. App Service does support Linux but with only 5% discount over Windows Lack of equivalents for App Service Storage sizes in AKS and VM \u2014 next highest size was selected Pricing represents a single instance and would rise as instances are added to the App Service plans or AKS clusters Price savings of AKS over equivalent App Service Plans increases with higher App Service Plan Tiers Cost of AKS nodes similar to cost of VMs running Linux but there is a small discount with D_v2 instances Syntax of Node column in the table is \u201cinstance type\u201d + \u201cstorage type\u201d: storage size No pricing for Windows containers under AKS until GA App Services are legacy technology for Microsoft Azure \u2014 no major announcements or blog posts since 2017. 3 3 More from Nature of Clouds Reflections on the fundamental nature of cloud computing and open source\n[3]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modernize-with-azure-containers/modernize-existing-apps-to-cloud-optimized/choosing-azure-compute-options-for-container-based-applications --- Title: Choosing Azure compute platforms for container-based ... --- Body: Choosing Azure compute platforms for container-based applications | Microsoft Docs Modernizing .NET apps e-book Choosing Azure compute platforms for container-based applications Article 04/14/2022 2 minutes to read 10 contributors Tip This content is an excerpt from the eBook, Modernize existing .NET applications with Azure cloud and Windows Containers, available on .NET Docs or as a free downloadable PDF that can be read offline. Download PDF As you have noticed after reading the previous sections, Azure is an open cloud that offers multiple choices. You can use the best fit for your needs, however, it also surfaces questions about what product/technology you should use for your containerized applications. As a by-default recommendation, the following is the main criteria recommended in this guidance: Single monolithic app: Choose Azure App Service N-Tier app: Choose orchestrators such as Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or App Service if you have a single or a few back-end services Microservices: Choose AKS or Azure Web Apps for Containers Serverless functions & event handlers: Choose Azure Functions Large-scale Batch: Choose Azure Batch However, this recommendation should be taken with a pinch of salt, as the product's selection will depend on your specific application's needs and characteristics. Not all applications are the same even when initially they might look similar types. After a deeper analysis of the application's needs, the product selected could be different. But, as a starting point, it is good to have initial guidance from where you can start evaluating and testing based on certain priority.

You may not need the overhead of a Kubernetes deployment. App Services provides security, load balancing, autoscaling, and automated management. In addition, App Services has DevOps capabilities, such as continuous deployment from Azure DevOps, GitHub, Docker Hub, and other sources, package management, staging environments, custom domain, and TLS/SSL certificates. By fully-managed, we mean App Service automatically patches and maintains the OS and language frameworks for you. Spend time writing great apps and let Azure worry about the platform. With App Services Environment, deploy your application within a virtual network you define where you can have fine-grained control over inbound and outbound application network traffic. App Service Plans One or more of your applications run inside an App Service Plan. An App Service plan defines a set of compute resources for a web app to run. You can think of the App Services compute resources as a server farm. One or more apps can be configured to run on the same computing resources (or in the same App Service plan). When you create a App Service plan, you define: Region (West US, East US, etc.) Number of VM instances Size of VM instances (Small, Medium, Large) Pricing tier (Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, PremiumV3, Isolated) Pricing tiers define the features and the number of web applications that can be hosted within the plan. Apps deployed in the Free and Shared tiers run in worker processes on shared virtual machines, while apps deployed in the Standard and Premium tiers run on virtual machine(s) dedicated specifically for the apps associated with a single customer. The Isolated tier allow you to run apps in your dedicated virtual networks with even better scale and performance through an intuitive user experience. When the app runs, it runs on all the VM instances configured in the App Service plan. If multiple apps are in the same App Service plan, they all share the same VM instances.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Azure App Service are both popular options for deploying and managing applications on the Azure cloud platform. \n\nAzure App Service is a platform as a service (PaaS) offering that allows you to easily deploy and scale web apps, mobile app backends, and RESTful APIs. It provides a fully managed environment with features such as security, load balancing, auto-scaling, and automated management [[4]](https://azuredays.com/2020/11/09/alternatives-to-azure-kubernetes-service-aks-azure-app-services). App Service is a great choice when you want a simple and quick way to host your applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.\n\nOn the other hand, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a fully managed container orchestration service based on the popular Kubernetes platform. It provides the ability to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications using the power of Kubernetes. AKS is more suitable for complex applications that require advanced container orchestration, scalability, and flexibility. It allows you to have fine-grained control over your application deployment and provides features like namespace isolation and open-source monitoring tool integration [[1]](https://ls-lrt.com/which-service-to-use-azure-kubernetes-services-or-azure-app-service-a-curated-topic).\n\nTo summarize, you can consider using Azure App Service when you have a straightforward web app or API that doesn't require advanced container orchestration features. It's a great fit for smaller projects and teams who want a simple and easy-to-use hosting environment.\n\nOn the other hand, if you have a more complex application with multiple services, microservices, or a need for advanced scalability and flexibility, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) would be a better choice. AKS allows you to leverage the power of Kubernetes for deploying and managing containerized applications at scale.\n\nUltimately, the choice between AKS and App Service depends on your specific application requirements and the level of control and scalability you need. I hope this clarifies the difference between the two services.

To learn more, review vCore-based purchasing model and compare purchasing models. Database transaction units (DTUs) A database transaction unit (DTU) represents a blended measure of CPU, memory, reads, and writes. Service tiers in the DTU-based purchasing model are differentiated by a range of compute sizes with a fixed amount of included storage, fixed retention period for backups, and fixed price. All service tiers in the DTU-based purchasing model provide flexibility of changing compute sizes with minimal downtime; however, there is a switch over period where connectivity is lost to the database for a short amount of time, which can be mitigated using retry logic. Single databases and elastic pools are billed hourly based on service tier and compute size. For a single database at a specific compute size within a service tier, Azure SQL Database guarantees a certain level of resources for that database (independent of any other database). This guarantee provides a predictable level of performance. The amount of resources allocated for a database is calculated as a number of DTUs and is a bundled measure of compute, storage, and I/O resources. The ratio among these resources is originally determined by an online transaction processing (OLTP) benchmark workload designed to be typical of real-world OLTP workloads. When your workload exceeds the amount of any of these resources, your throughput is throttled, resulting in slower performance and time-outs. For single databases, the resources used by your workload don't impact the resources available to other databases in the Azure cloud. Likewise, the resources used by other workloads don't impact the resources available to your database. DTUs are most useful for understanding the relative resources that are allocated for databases at different compute sizes and service tiers. For example: Doubling the DTUs by increasing the compute size of a database equates to doubling the set of resources available to that database. A premium service tier P11 database with 1750 DTUs provides\n[3]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/error-codes-solutions --- Title: Troubleshoot common errors in Azure Cosmos DB's API for Mongo DB --- Body: Troubleshoot common errors in Azure Cosmos DB's API for Mongo DB | Microsoft Docs Azure Cosmos DB MongoDB API Troubleshoot common issues in Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB Article 08/09/2021 5 minutes to read 2 contributors In this article Common errors and solutions Next steps APPLIES TO: Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB The following article describes common errors and solutions for deployments using the Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB. Note Azure Cosmos DB does not host the MongoDB engine. It provides an implementation of the MongoDB wire protocol version 4.0, 3.6, and legacy support for wire protocol version 3.2. Therefore, some of these errors are only found in Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB. Common errors and solutions Code Error Description Solution 2 BadValue One common cause is that an index path corresponding to the specified order-by item is excluded or the order by query does not have a corresponding composite index that it can be served from. The query requests a sort on a field that is not indexed. Create a matching index (or composite index) for the sort query being attempted. 2 Transaction is not active The multi-document transaction surpassed the fixed 5 second time limit. Retry the multi-document transaction or limit the scope of operations within the multi-document transaction to make it complete within the 5 second time limit. 13 Unauthorized The request lacks the permissions to complete. Ensure you are using the correct keys. 26 NamespaceNotFound The database or collection being referenced in the query cannot be found. Ensure your database/collection name precisely matches the name in your query. 50 ExceededTimeLimit The request has exceeded the timeout of 60 seconds of execution. There can be many causes for this error. One of the causes is when the currently allocated request units capacity is not sufficient to complete the request. This can be solved by increasing the request units of that collection or database. In other cases, this error can be worked-around by splitting a large request into smaller ones. Retrying a write operation that has received this error may result in a duplicate write. If you are trying to delete large amounts of data without impacting RUs: - Consider using TTL (Based on Timestamp): Expire data with Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB - Use Cursor/Batch size to perform the delete. You can fetch a single document at a time and delete it\n[4]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/quota-increase-request --- Title: Request a quota increase - Azure SQL Database | Microsoft Docs --- Body: Request a quota increase - Azure SQL Database | Microsoft Docs Docs Resources Troubleshoot Request quota increases for Azure SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance Article 04/25/2022 3 minutes to read 9 contributors In this article Create a new support request SQL Database quota types Submit your request Next steps APPLIES TO: Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance This article explains how to request a quota increase for Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance.

New commerce experience in CSP for Azure expanding to Government Community Cloud (GCC) Summary On August 24, 2021, the new commerce experience in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program for Azure will be available to all Government Community Cloud (GCC) partners.\n[5]: URL: https://infohub.delltechnologies.com/p/microsoft-azure-stack-and-csp-uncovered --- Title: Microsoft Azure Stack and CSP Uncovered | Dell ... --- Body: Microsoft Azure Stack and CSP Uncovered | Dell Technologies Info Hub Home > Integrated Products > Integrated System for Azure Stack Hub > Blogs > Microsoft Azure Stack and CSP Uncovered Microsoft Azure Stack and CSP Uncovered March 23rd, 2020 | Read Time: 10 minutes Jayanth Yk Microsoft Azure Stack and CSP Uncovered Microsoft\u2019s Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program allows partners to completely own their end-to-end customer lifecycle, which may include activities such as deployment of new services, provisioning, management, pricing and billing. The CSP program helps value-added resellers (VARs) and managed service providers (MSPs) sell Microsoft software and Cloud Service licenses with additional support so that you can become more involved with your customer base. This means that every cloud solution from Azure to Office 365 could be resold to your customers at a price that you set, and with unique value added by you. The goal of the CSP program is not simply to resell Microsoft services, but to enhance them and deliver them in a way that makes sense for you and your customers. What's the fuss all about Azure Stack CSPs? As an Azure Stack Product Technologist, one question I am frequently asked by customers who are existing Microsoft CSPs is, how to operate and offer services on Microsoft Azure Stack in a CSP model. Although this information is available through Microsoft Azure Stack online documentation and videos from various events, I am trying to consolidate that information into this blogpost as well as trying to explain the various CSP operating models in Azure Stack and the steps required to successfully manage and operate Azure Stack as a CSP. The key difference between operating as an Azure CSP vs Azure Stack CSP is the additional responsibility of managing the Azure Stack Integrated system. Really? well, it really depends on the CSP operating model which we will discuss in detail in the subsequent sections in this blog. What's the Business Opportunity here? Today, Azure services are available in 54 regions spread across various geographical locations. Which also means that Azure services are not available in every nook and corner of the globe. This could be due to poor internet connectivity or no connectivity or customers want to operate in a disconnected mode or to simply meet the regulatory compliance, adhering to the policy guidelines and laws in the respective country of origin.

General Question Hi all, I am new to this and I'm planning a deployment of brand new corporate-issued devices in a user-driven InTune setup. InTune and Autopilot on OEM/vanilla Win10 image - no SCCM etc. How have you gone about restricting the Device options in Azure AD \"Users may join devices to Azure AD\"? From what I can tell, I have two options: Allow all users to join their devices to Azure AD and remove after the deployment; or Pre-provision the devices (white glove) using dedicated accounts with the permission to join to Azure AD and and then reseal the PC. I assume the device owner in Intune will change once the user logs in after that point? The default setting of \"All\" for \"Users may join devices to Azure AD\" seems like it could cause a fair amount of issues to me and I find it odd that most online articles for InTune setups I've read suggests 'All' to be set.

Someone who isn\u2019t very smart or someone who wants to cause you a headache may enroll their personal device (often unintentionally) and that will waste your time. If you have them in autopilot they are already registered and you can manage them from there, and even set up naming conventions etc. If the device isn\u2019t registered in autopilot, Ensure the devices have the proper edition of Windows 10 and enroll them in autopilot. Do nothing else in oobe other than running the autopilot enrollment script on the command prompt and then shut it down. It\u2019ll upload the device up into Endpoint Manager but won\u2019t do much of anything until a user who is licensed for Security + Mobility sets up the device when they turn it on. Some manufacturers will upload units into your tenant for you if you are buying directly from them. Give the device about 10-15 minutes before issuing it to a user after enrolling it into autopilot before your OOBE setup policies take effect.\n[3]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/devices/azureadjoin-plan --- Title: How to plan your Azure Active Directory join ... --- Body: Plan your Azure Active Directory join deployment | Microsoft Docs Azure Active Directory Devices How to: Plan your Azure AD join implementation Article 02/15/2022 11 minutes to read 15 contributors In this article Prerequisites Plan your implementation Review your scenarios Review your identity infrastructure Assess your device management Understand considerations for applications and resources Understand your provisioning options Configure your device settings Configure your mobility settings Configure enterprise state roaming Configure Conditional Access Next steps Azure AD join allows you to join devices directly to Azure AD without the need to join to on-premises Active Directory while keeping your users productive and secure. Azure AD join is enterprise-ready for both at-scale and scoped deployments. SSO access to on-premises resources is also available to devices that are Azure AD joined. For more information, see How SSO to on-premises resources works on Azure AD joined devices. This article provides you with the information you need to plan your Azure AD join implementation. Prerequisites This article assumes that you're familiar with the Introduction to device management in Azure Active Directory. Plan your implementation To plan your Azure AD join implementation, you should familiarize yourself with: Review your scenarios Review your identity infrastructure Assess your device management Understand considerations for applications and resources Understand your provisioning options Configure enterprise state roaming Configure Conditional Access Review your scenarios While hybrid Azure AD join may be preferred for certain scenarios, Azure AD join enables you to transition towards a cloud-first model with Windows. If you're planning to modernize your devices management and reduce device-related IT costs, Azure AD join provides a great foundation towards achieving those goals. Consider Azure AD join if your goals align with the following criteria: You're adopting Microsoft 365 as the productivity suite for your users. You want to manage devices with a cloud device management solution. You want to simplify device provisioning for geographically distributed users. You plan to modernize your application infrastructure. Review your identity infrastructure Azure AD join works in managed and federated environments. We think most organizations will deploy hybrid Azure AD join with managed domains. Managed domain scenarios don't require configuring a federation server.

Applicable to all users in an organization Device ownership Organization Operating Systems All Windows 11 and Windows 10 devices except Home editions Windows Server 2019 Virtual Machines running in Azure (Server core isn't supported) Provisioning Self-service: Windows Out of Box Experience (OOBE) or Settings Bulk enrollment Windows Autopilot Device sign in options Organizational accounts using: Password Windows Hello for Business FIDO2.0 security keys (preview) Device management Mobile Device Management (example: Microsoft Intune) Configuration Manager standalone or co-management with Microsoft Intune Key capabilities SSO to both cloud and on-premises resources Conditional Access through MDM enrollment and MDM compliance evaluation Self-service Password Reset and Windows Hello PIN reset on lock screen Azure AD joined devices are signed in to using an organizational Azure AD account. Access to resources can be controlled based on Azure AD account and Conditional Access policies applied to the device. Administrators can secure and further control Azure AD joined devices using Mobile Device Management (MDM) tools like Microsoft Intune or in co-management scenarios using Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager. These tools provide a means to enforce organization-required configurations like: Requiring storage to be encrypted Password complexity Software installation Software updates Administrators can make organization applications available to Azure AD joined devices using Configuration Manager to Manage apps from the Microsoft Store for Business and Education. Azure AD join can be accomplished using self-service options like the Out of Box Experience (OOBE), bulk enrollment, or Windows Autopilot. Azure AD joined devices can still maintain single sign-on access to on-premises resources when they are on the organization's network. Devices that are Azure AD joined can still authenticate to on-premises servers like file, print, and other applications.

Best Regards, Alex Simons (Twitter: @Alex_A_Simons ) Director of Program Management Microsoft Identity and Security Division ----- Hi everyone, I'm Gary Henderson, and I've been working on bringing Azure AD scenarios to life in Windows 10. Today, I'm going to focus on the ability to sign in to Windows 10 with your Azure AD account. To do that, I'll be covering these details of joining a device to Azure AD: Self-provisioning of corporate owned devices Use existing organizational accounts to sign in Single Sign-On (SSO) to company resources in the cloud Single Sign-on to on-premises resources Azure AD join sweet spots The first question customers ask about Azure AD join is \"How is this different from domain join?\" Domain join gets you the best on-premises experiences on devices capable of domain joining, while Azure AD join is optimized for users that primarily access cloud resources.

It allows organizations to manage and control user access to resources such as applications, data, and services in the Azure cloud environment. Azure AD provides features such as user authentication, single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control. It can be integrated with both cloud-based and on-premises applications, making it easier for organizations to secure their resources and manage user identities across different platforms. [[4]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/devices/concept-azure-ad-join)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How important is to join devices to azure ad ?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Joining devices to Azure AD is important for several reasons. \n\nFirst, by joining devices to Azure AD, organizations can centralize the management of user identities and access control. This enables IT administrators to easily provision and deprovision user accounts, enforce security policies, and control access to resources. It also provides a seamless sign-on experience for users, allowing them to access applications and services with their Azure AD credentials.\n\nSecond, joining devices to Azure AD enables organizations to implement a cloud-first approach to device management. This means that devices can be managed and secured directly from the Azure portal, using tools such as Microsoft Intune. This simplifies device management, reduces IT costs, and allows for more efficient deployment and management of devices.\n\nAdditionally, by joining devices to Azure AD, organizations can take advantage of features such as single sign-on and conditional access. Single sign-on allows users to sign in once with their Azure AD credentials and then access multiple resources without the need to sign in again. Conditional access allows organizations to enforce additional security measures, such as multi-factor authentication, based on specific conditions or risk factors.\n\nOverall, joining devices to Azure AD provides a secure and streamlined approach to device management and access control in the organization.

When you open a Recovery Services vault from the list, the Overview dashboard for the selected vault, opens. The dashboard provides various details about the vault. There are tiles that show: the status of critical and warning alerts, in-progress and failed backup jobs, and the amount of locally redundant storage (LRS) and geo-redundant storage (GRS) used. If you back up Azure VMs to the vault, the Backup Pre-Check Status tile displays any critical or warning items. The following image is the Overview dashboard for Contoso-vault. The Backup Items tile shows there are nine items registered to the vault. The prerequisites for this article are: an Azure subscription, a Recovery Services vault, and that there's at least one backup item configured for the vault. Note Azure has two different deployment models you can use to create and work with resources: Azure Resource Manager and classic. This article covers the use of the Resource Manager deployment model. We recommend the Resource Manager deployment model for new deployments instead of the classic deployment model. Open a Recovery Services vault To monitor alerts, or view management data about a Recovery Services vault, open the vault. Sign in to the Azure portal using your Azure subscription. In the portal, select All services. In the All services dialog box, type Recovery Services. As you begin typing, the list filters based on your input.

Your keys encrypt the backup data must be stored in Azure Key Vault. The encryption key used for encrypting backups may be different from the one used for the source. The data is protected using an AES 256 based data encryption key (DEK), which in turn, is protected using your key encryption keys (KEK). This provides you with full control over the data and the keys. To allow encryption, you must grant Recovery Services vault the permissions to access the encryption key in the Azure Key Vault. You can change the key when required. This article discusses about how to: Create a Recovery Services vault Configure your Recovery Services vault to encrypt the backup data using customer-managed keys (CMK) Back up to vaults encrypted using customer-managed keys Restore data from backups Before you start This feature allows you to encrypt new Recovery Services vaults only. Any vaults containing existing items registered or attempted to be registered to it aren't supported. Once enabled for a Recovery Services vault, encryption using customer-managed keys can't be reverted to use platform-managed keys (default). You can change the encryption keys as per the requirements. This feature currently doesn't support backup using MARS agent, and you may not be able to use a CMK-encrypted vault for the same. The MARS agent uses a user passphrase-based encryption. This feature also doesn't support backup of classic VMs. This feature isn't related to Azure Disk Encryption, which uses guest-based encryption of a VM's disk using BitLocker (for Windows) and DM-Crypt (for Linux). The Recovery Services vault can be encrypted only with keys stored in Azure Key Vault, located in the same region. Also, keys must be RSA keys only and should be in enabled state.

You'll also use Cross Region Restore to restore in a secondary region. Create a Recovery Services vault A Recovery Services vault is a management entity that stores recovery points created over time and provides an interface to perform backup-related operations. These operations include taking on-demand backups, performing restores, and creating backup policies. To create a Recovery Services vault: Sign in to your subscription in the Azure portal. Search for Backup center in the Azure portal, and go to the Backup Center dashboard. Select +Vault from the Overview tab. Select Recovery Services vault > Continue. The Recovery Services vault dialog opens. Provide the following values: Subscription: Choose the subscription to use. If you're a member of only one subscription, you'll see that name. If you're not sure which subscription to use, use the default (suggested) subscription. There are multiple choices only if your work or school account is associated with more than one Azure subscription. Resource group: Use an existing resource group or create a new one. To see the list of available resource groups in your subscription, select Use existing, and then select a resource from the dropdown list. To create a new resource group, select Create new and enter the name. For more information about resource groups, see Azure Resource Manager overview. Vault name: Enter a friendly name to identify the vault. The name must be unique to the Azure subscription. Specify a name that has at least 2 but not more than 50 characters. The name must start with a letter and consist only of letters, numbers, and hyphens. Region: Select the geographic region for the vault. For you to create a vault to help protect any data source, the vault must be in the same region as the data source. Important If you're not sure of the location of your data source, close the dialog.

Next steps This article explains how to move a Recovery Services vault configured for Azure Backup across Azure subscriptions, or to another resource group in the same subscription. You can use the Azure portal or PowerShell to move a Recovery Services vault. Supported regions All public regions and sovereign regions are supported, except France South, France Central, Germany Northeast and Germany Central. Prerequisites for moving Recovery Services vault During vault move across resource groups, both the source and target resource groups are locked preventing the write and delete operations. For more information, see this article. Only admin subscription has the permissions to move a vault. For moving vaults across subscriptions, the target subscription must reside in the same tenant as the source subscription and its state must be enabled. To move a vault to a different Azure AD, see Transfer subscription to a different directory and Recovery Service vault FAQs. You must have permission to perform write operations on the target resource group. Moving the vault only changes the resource group. The Recovery Services vault will reside on the same location and it can't be changed. You can move only one Recovery Services vault, per region, at a time. If a VM doesn't move with the Recovery Services vault across subscriptions, or to a new resource group, the current VM recovery points will remain intact in the vault until they expire.

No matter how many times you read the administrators installation guide there may be some items that are missing that wasn\u2019t included in the documentation or a particular scenario not thought of. Azure file shares is no different and there are some common hiccups that can be avoided with good planning. This blog post is going to give you some tips and tricks to get started with Azure file shares to help eliminate some of those bumps that you may run into. Intros please First off, I want to give a quick intro as to what Azure file shares is for those that are hearing about this for the time. The official description of Azure file shares is: \u201cFully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via Server Message Block (SMB) protocol (also known as Common Internet File System or CIFS). Azure File shares can be mounted concurrently by cloud or on-premises deployments of Windows, Linux, and macOS.\u201d The short version is: A file share that is in the cloud. Azure file shares can be used to completely replace or supplement traditional on-premises file servers or NAS devices. They can be used by Windows, macOS, and Linux which can directly mount Azure file shares wherever they are in the world. If you are thinking of using this to replace your local file shares you will need to use Azure file Sync and be running Windows server 2016. You can use it for more than supplementing your local file server such as, Azure files can be used to in a lift and shift migration into Azure. This also works well for Hybrid scenario, where the application data is moved to Azure Files, and the application continues to run on-premises. An Azure file share is also a good for cloud applications to write their logs, metrics, and crash dumps. With security on everyone\u2019s mind you\u2019re probably asking how is this secured?

It is important to know how to block/disable/close TCP port 445, 135, 139 opened by system on Windows 7/10/XP/Server 2003/2008 step by step. By Lily/ Last update January 13, 2022 Overview of WannaCry WannaCry, also known as Wanna Decryptor ransomware has ran amuck on computers all over the world since the afternoon of May 12, 2017. Important files and documents are encrypted and are blackmailed for $300 to $600 value of virtual Bitcoin currency. By now, no effective decrypt methods found. Except for helpless waiting for the cure, there are some things we can do to prevent infection and make things better. It is said that the WannaCry virus infect hard drive via TCP port 445 which opened by system during installing, so does to Petya variant virus. Following details how to block port 445 in Windows 7, 10, and XP in easy and simple ways. But before that, you may want to know what TCP port 445 is used for, so is the port 139. Port 445 and Port 139 Port 445 and port 139 are Windows ports. Port 139 is used for Network Basic Input Output System (NetBIOS) name resolution and port 445 is used for Server Message Blocks (SMB). They all serve Windows File and Printer Sharing. In Windows 2000, Microsoft has created a new transport for SMB over TCP and UDP on port 445, which replaces the older implementation that was over ports 137, 138, 139. Keep port 445 and port 139 opened will leave the hard disks exposed on this port, i.e. you share your hard drives with any one that can access to this port, including deleting, formating, and implant virus and so on. You may understand port 445 in this way. If you close port 445, you will not be able to copy any file system data to or from the path where port 445 is closed. In terms of domain host, this will definitely break group policy. You will lose browsing capabilities to networks past the intranet network as well.

The SMB protocol requires TCP port 445 to be open; connections will fail if port 445 is blocked. You can check if your firewall is blocking port 445 with the Test-NetConnection cmdlet. To learn about ways to work around a blocked 445 port, see the Cause 1: Port 445 is blocked section of our Windows troubleshooting guide. To check if your firewall or ISP is blocking port 445, use the AzFileDiagnostics tool or Test-NetConnection cmdlet. Azure Files only allows connections using SMB 3.0 (with encryption support) from outside the region or datacenter. SMB 3.0 protocol has introduced many security features including channel encryption which is very secure to use over internet. However its possible that port 445 has been blocked due to historical reasons of vulnerabilities found in lower SMB versions. In ideal case, the port should be blocked for only for SMB 1.0 traffic and SMB 1.0 should be turned off on all clients. If you have ever been blocked using Azure Files due to your ISP's port 445, you can setup a Point to Site VPN to your Azure Files. Refer to the suggestions mentioned in the GitHub article You can mount the file share on your local machine by using the SMB 3.0 protocol, or you can use tools like Storage Explorer to access files in your file share.

First, you'll need to create a virtual network in Azure where your domain controller will reside. This will provide the networking infrastructure for your domain.\n\n2. Next, you'll create a virtual machine (VM) in Azure that will serve as your domain controller. You can choose from various VM sizes depending on your requirements.\n\n3. Once the VM is created, you'll need to configure it with the necessary roles and features. This includes installing the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role, which turns the VM into a domain controller.\n\n4. During the domain controller configuration process, you'll need to provide a domain name. This can be a new domain or an existing domain that you want to replicate into Azure. You'll also need to create and enter a strong password for the domain admin account.\n\n5. After the domain controller is set up, you'll want to configure the network settings, such as DNS resolution and network security groups, to ensure proper communication with other resources in Azure.\n\n6. Lastly, you'll need to join other VMs or resources to the domain by configuring their network settings to point to the domain controller's IP address as the preferred DNS server.\n\nThis is just a summary of the process. Keep in mind that domain controller setup in Azure may have additional considerations depending on your specific requirements and network architecture.

Create a virtual network: Navigate to the Virtual networks page and create a virtual network if you don't have one already. This will provide the networking infrastructure for your domain controller.\n\n3. Create a virtual machine: Navigate to the Virtual machines page and click on \"Add\" to create a new virtual machine. Choose the appropriate VM size and configure other settings like the operating system, disk, and networking.\n\n4. Configure the VM: Provide the necessary information like the VM name, username, and password. Choose the appropriate subscription, resource group, and virtual network. You can also enable public IP access if required.\n\n5. Configure the AD DS role: Once the VM is created, connect to it using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and open Server Manager. Click on \"Manage\" and select \"Add Roles and Features\" to open the wizard. Select the Active Directory Domain Services role and follow the prompts to install it.\n\n6. Promote the VM to a domain controller: After the AD DS role is installed, open the Active Directory Domain Services Configuration Wizard. Select \"Add a domain controller to an existing domain\" or \"Add a new forest\" depending on your requirements. Provide the necessary domain details and follow the prompts to complete the configuration.\n\n7. Configure DNS settings: Open the DNS Manager on the domain controller and configure the necessary DNS settings, such as forwarders or conditional forwarding, to ensure proper name resolution.\n\n8.

Here are some best practices and security guidelines to consider when deploying a domain controller VM and configuring AD DS in Azure:\n\n1. Use a dedicated virtual machine: It is recommended to use a dedicated virtual machine for the domain controller role to avoid resource contention with other applications or services.\n\n2. Use managed disks: When creating the virtual machine, use managed disks instead of unmanaged disks for improved reliability and performance.\n\n3. Enable Azure Backup: Configure Azure Backup for the virtual machine hosting the domain controller to enable data protection and disaster recovery.\n\n4. Configure network security groups (NSGs): Apply NSGs to the virtual network and subnet to restrict inbound and outbound traffic to the domain controller. Follow the principle of least privilege and allow only necessary protocols and ports.\n\n5. Enable Just-In-Time (JIT) access: Consider enabling JIT access to the virtual machine to limit RDP or SSH access to specific time intervals and IP addresses.\n\n6. Regularly update the domain controller: Keep the domain controller VM up to date with the latest security updates and patches provided by Microsoft.\n\n7. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA): Enable MFA for administrative accounts to add an extra layer of security against unauthorized access.\n\n8. Monitor and audit: Set up alerts, logging, and monitoring mechanisms to track and detect any suspicious activities on the domain controller. Use Azure Monitor or other monitoring tools to gather insights and generate reports.\n\n9. Implement network segmentation: Consider using virtual network subnets and network security groups to isolate the domain controller from other resources in Azure. This helps contain the impact of security breaches or unauthorized access.\n\n10. Regular backups and disaster recovery: Implement a backup strategy for the domain controller VM and regularly test the restoration process to ensure data availability in case of accidental deletions or system failures.\n\nRemember, these guidelines are a starting point, and it's important to review and implement the specific security requirements and recommendations for your organization.

Network latency: If you have resources or users located in different regions, network latency can impact performance. Consider deploying domain controllers closer to the resources or users to minimize latency.\n\n2. Resource limitations: The choice of VM size for the domain controller may be limited by the availability of certain VM sizes in specific regions. Ensure that you select a VM size that meets your performance requirements and is available in your desired region.\n\n3. Active Directory replication: Replicating Active Directory data between on-premises domain controllers and Azure domain controllers may have some limitations and require careful planning. Consult Microsoft documentation for guidance on configuring and troubleshooting replication in hybrid environments.\n\n4. Scalability: The scalability of your domain controller setup in Azure may be limited by the number of VMs or VM sizes you can deploy. Plan ahead for future growth and consider Azure AD services like Azure AD Domain Services for larger-scale needs.\n\n5.

A detailed breakdown dd - the day of the month from 01 to 31. Note this is lower case and this format gives a leading 0. Using d for no leading 0 MMM - the abbreviated name of the month, eg JAN, FEB, MAR. Note this is upper case yyyy - the year as a four-digit number. Note this is lower case hh - the hour using a 12-hour clock from 01 to 12. Note this is lower case. As you are using AM/PM it makes sense to have the 12-hour clock rather than 24 (ie 23:00 PM would not make sense). Note this is lower case mm - the minute from 00 to 50. Note this is lower case ss - the second from 00 to 50. Note this is lower case tt - the AM/PM designator. Note this is lower case So using this information, your code should be more like this: @formatDateTime(pipeline().TriggerTime, 'dd-MMM-yyyy hh:mm:ss tt') I have test the expression using a Set Variable activity and got the following results: Share Improve this answer answered Mar 10, 2021 at 10:08 wBob 12.3k 3 17 35 Add a comment\n[2]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/control-flow-expression-language-functions --- Title: Expression and functions - Azure Data Factory & Azure Synapse --- Body: Expression and functions - Azure Data Factory & Azure Synapse | Microsoft Docs Azure Data Factory Expressions and functions in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse Analytics Article 12/01/2021 54 minutes to read 23 contributors In this article Expressions Examples Functions Date functions String functions Collection functions Logical functions Conversion functions Math functions Function reference Next steps Select the version of Data Factory service you are using: Current version/Synapse version APPLIES TO: Azure Data Factory Azure Synapse Analytics This article provides details about expressions and functions supported by Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse Analytics. Expressions JSON values in the definition can be literal or expressions that are evaluated at runtime. For example: JSON Copy \"name\": \"value\" or JSON Copy \"name\": \"@pipeline().parameters.password\" Expressions can appear anywhere in a JSON string value and always result in another JSON value. If a JSON value is an expression, the body of the expression is extracted by removing the at-sign (@). If a literal string is needed that starts with @, it must be escaped by using @@. The following examples show how expressions are evaluated. JSON value Result \"parameters\" The characters 'parameters' are returned. \"parameters[1]\" The characters 'parameters[1]' are returned. \"@@\" A 1 character string that contains '@' is returned. \" @\" A 2 character string that contains ' @' is returned. Expressions can also appear inside strings, using a feature called string interpolation where expressions are wrapped in @{ ... }. For example: \"name\" : \"First Name: @{pipeline().parameters.firstName} Last Name: @{pipeline().parameters.lastName}\" Using string interpolation, the result is always a string. Say I have defined myNumber as 42 and myString as foo: JSON value Result \"@pipeline().parameters.myString\" Returns foo as a string. \"@{pipeline().parameters.myString}\" Returns foo as a string. \"@pipeline().parameters.myNumber\" Returns 42 as a number. \"@{pipeline().parameters.myNumber}\" Returns 42 as a string. \"Answer is: @{pipeline().parameters.myNumber}\" Returns the string Answer is: 42. \"@concat('Answer is: ', string(pipeline().parameters.myNumber))\" Returns the string Answer is: 42 \"Answer is: @@{pipeline().parameters.myNumber}\" Returns the string Answer is: @{pipeline().parameters.myNumber}. In the control flow activities like ForEach activity, you can provide an array to be iterated over for the property items and use @item() to iterate over a single enumeration in ForEach activity. For example, if items is an array: [1, 2, 3], @item() returns 1 in the first iteration, 2 in the second iteration, and 3 in the third iteration. You can also use @range(0,10) like expression to iterate ten times starting with 0 ending\n[3]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/format-datetimefunction --- Title: \ue000format\ue001_datetime() - Azure Data Explorer | Microsoft Docs --- Body: format_datetime() - Azure Data Explorer | Microsoft Docs Kusto Kusto Query Language Scalar functions format_datetime() Article 03/06/2022 3 minutes to read 6 contributors In this article Syntax Arguments Returns Supported formats Examples Formats a datetime according to the provided format.

I wanted to share with you how we implemented flexible date parameters for an Azure Data Factory pipeline in a recent project. Names, places, industries, widgets and other identifying information have been changed for entertainment purposes. The Scenario Hakamada Industries wants to keep track of their Big Kahuna Surfboards manufacturing subsidiary. Hakamada\u2019s corporate offices are in Tokyo (UTC+9) and Big Kahuna Surfboards operates in Honolulu (UTC-10). Big Kahuna Surfboards has a REST API that will take StartDate and EndDate parameters in Hawaiian Standard Time and return data that has been updated in the specified time-frame. Mr. Hakamada wants to have an automated pipeline that grabs the updated data from the API daily, and he also wants to be able to grab data from the API for whatever date range he wants. Hakamada Industries would prefer Azure Data Factory to be used because that is where all of their other ETL processes live. Most Azure resources and services use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by default. For those of you keeping track at home, we\u2019re dealing with Tokyo (UTC+9), Azure (UTC) and Honolulu (UTC-10) The wrinkle Dealing with different time-zones was one of the date/time challenges we faced in this project. On top of that we had to work around limitations and assumptions made by an API that was out of our control. DateTimes or Time values cannot be specified in Big Kahuna Surfboards\u2019 API due to the ancient setup they are running. Despite their API not accepting them, DateTimes are ultimately what are being queried on the back end by the API. This means that providing the API with a StartDate and EndDate of 2000/10/10 will not return all of the surfboards made on October 10 2000, because both dates translate to 2000/10/10 00:00:00. No one makes surfboards at midnight, and even if they did, the API would only return the surfboards made in that 1 second. Because of this wrinkle, when looking for the most recent full day of surfboard production, the StartDate must be: TODAY \u2013 1.

Timezone considerations: Azure Data Factory typically uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by default. If you need to work with datetime values in a specific timezone, you may need to convert the values accordingly. You can use functions like `convertTimeZone` or `addToTime` to handle timezone conversions.\n\n2.

If you need to perform any calculations or comparisons with datetime values, you may need to convert them to the appropriate data type using functions like `toDateTime` or `toUnixTimestamp`.\n\n4. Available functions: Azure Data Factory provides a range of functions to work with datetime values, such as `utcNow`, `currentTimestamp`, `addDays`, `addHours`, and more. These functions can be useful for generating or manipulating datetime values in your pipelines.\n\nIt's always a good practice to test your expressions and functions in Azure Data Factory pipelines to ensure they are giving you the expected results.

Precision: Azure Data Factory supports datetime values with millisecond precision. If you require higher precision, such as microsecond or nanosecond, you may need to handle those values separately.\n\n2. Timezone conversions: While Azure Data Factory provides functions for timezone conversions, it's important to note that the accuracy of timezone conversions depends on the time zone information available in the system. If you encounter any discrepancies or issues with timezone conversions, you may need to consider handling them manually.\n\n3. Function compatibility: Not all functions available in other programming languages or platforms are supported in Azure Data Factory. Make sure to check the documentation or test your expressions to ensure that the functions you intend to use are supported in Azure Data Factory.\n\n4. Data source limitations: The limitations and capabilities of the data sources you are working with may also impact how datetime values are handled.

We are an Office 365 Customer with Azure Premium. Non MFA-enabled users are able to authenticate and connect via the VPN. MFA-enabled users cannot. The extension sends an authentication approval request to the user's device, but when approved, it doesn't authenticate the user, and a 6274 error is generated in the security log from NPS with \"The request was discarded by a third-party extension DLL file\". Ran the script at http://azuredummies.com/2018/09/11/azure-mfa-nps-extension-health-check-script-v1/ and things seemed generally OK. This used to work when I first installed the NPS extension, but stopped at some indeterminate time thereafter. Any ideas?

Can you confirm that you are using NpsExtnForAzureMfaInstaller.exe? https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54688 If you are saying that MFA-enabled users cannot authenticate, can you confirm that these users have the right licenses for MFA and are enabled for it?

It turns out if you want to enable Azure MFA with Microsoft NPS it\u2019s actually quite simple. So, I\u2019m using RADIUS auth (above) on my NPS server, and it\u2019s simply checking the authenticating user is a member of a domain security group. Once it has satisfied that requirement, it will authenticate against my Azure AD, which will trigger an MFA event, (in my case send a request to the Microsoft Authenticator Application on my Android Phone). Azure MFA With Microsoft NPS Pre-Requisites The remote user needs EITHER an Azure P1 License, or a Microsoft 365 license. \u201cBut I can use the Authenticator App with my Office 365 subscription?\u201d Well yes you can, but we are not authenticating to office 365 are we? Below you can prove the licence is allocated in Office 365 And the same in Azure AD. Now your user needs to have MFA enabled, (this should be pretty obvious), to use the Microsoft authenticator application the USER chooses that method of authentication, when you enable MFA for them (the first time they login). You can re-force that, from the following screen if you wish. Azure MFA With Microsoft NPS: Deploying NPS So I\u2019ve pretty much covered this half a dozen times before, but for completeness I\u2019ll quickly run though setting up NPS / NPAS.

Previously, it was set up to use certificate authentication, but we needed more accountability and control over who connects, so I changed it to user auth with radius. I followed instructions and set up NPAS on the server and installed the Nps Extension For Azure Mfa. I configured NPS as my radius server, set up some users in AD and was able to install the VPN client and connect...... Then the server rebooted. After that, I was unable to connect. The connection would hang at the authentication and eventually time out without connecting. The Security log tells me: The request was discarded by a third-party extension DLL file. If I remove the NPS extention, then remove NPAS, reboot, then install NPAS, make sure it finishes completely, then install the extension, I can log in again and everything is fine until the next reboot. I have looked everywhere online, read a lot of Microsoft articles, looked here, but I can't find anything to help me figure out what is going on here. If anyone can help, I can post configs, event logs, whatever you need.

RADIUS Client -> NPS Server with MFA Extension -> Azure MFA The above works just fine, I get a couple of discarded messages in the NPS log but that's normal according to MS. RADIUS Client -> NPS Server acting as a RADIUS Proxy -> NPS Server with MFA Extension -> Azure MFA. This however does not work at all, I get authentication failed in my VPN Client and the RADIUS communication goes completely crazy and my phones gets about 15-20 MFA requests during 2-3 mins, then it wears off. The NPS-log from the NPS-server with the extension get's spammed with: \"The request was discarded by a third-party extension DLL file.\" The NPS-log from the NPS-server acting as a RADIUS Proxy gets: \"The remote RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) server did not respond.\" every tenth second. I've tweaked the timeout settings for the Remote Radius Server but there is no difference.

We have it working with a 5-10 second timeout, 30 sec s/b more than enough. Logging is poor so make sure the logon works w/out MFA to rule out any RADIUS/NPS configuration problems. Either install NPS on a different server or remove the MFA plugin and then NPS, reboot and reinstall NPS role to test w/out MFA. Follow the instructions very carefully, we ran into different errors on different clients when installing the NPS MFA plugin. For instance, we've seen things like having to enable TLS 1.2 in PS to get the config script to execute without errors. Server 2019 has a bug where the default firewall rule for NPS doesn't work and one has to be manually created.

Let's look at two Microsoft products, Azure Backup and Azure Site Recovery, and see how they compare and contrast to protect data at both the VM level and the site level. Author Recent Posts Brandon Lee Brandon Lee has been in the IT industry 15+ years and focuses on networking and virtualization. He contributes to the community through various blog posts and technical documentation primarily at Virtualizationhowto.com. Contents What is Azure Backup? Azure Backup architecture What is Azure Site Recovery? Azure Site Recovery architecture Azure Backup vs. Azure Site Recovery Wrapping up Today, many businesses leverage public clouds in a major way as part of their BCDR strategy. Utilizing cloud storage for offsite backup storage as well as VM replication are two very popular use cases for protecting on-premises resources. Microsoft Azure is a predominant public cloud environment in use by businesses today and is a great place to store backups and replicate virtual machines. For seamless replication and integration with Azure for on-premises VMs, Microsoft has two different tools that you can make use of to perform replication and backups from on-premises to your Microsoft Azure IaaS environment. Let's take a look at Azure Backup vs. Azure Site Recovery and see how these two tools are used, how they are different, and what use case each allows businesses to solve. What is Azure Backup? ^ In the simplest of explanations, Azure Backup is a service that allows you to back up your data to the Microsoft Azure Cloud. This includes both on-premises VMs and Azure VMs . Azure Backup is a service that can supplement existing backup solutions or replace existing solutions altogether. Organizations who may look at Azure Backup can decide if Azure Backup can potentially replace existing solutions, as this could certainly lead to cost savings. Many businesses today are evolving in the way that they store and archive their data. Traditionally, tape backups have served as the medium for retaining data long term, which is often necessary due to regulatory requirements. Services like Azure Backup can potentially eliminate the need to store backups offsite on tape backups, as data is essentially stored \"offsite\" in secure data\n[2]: URL: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure/difference-between-azure-backup-amp-azure-site-recovery/td-p/1549429 --- Title: Difference between Azure Backup & Azure Site Recovery. --- Body: Difference between Azure Backup & Azure Site Recovery. - Microsoft Tech Community Home Azure Azure Difference between Azure Backup & Azure Site Recovery.

Azure Site Recovery Azure Site Recovery (ASR) is a disaster recovery solution for physical servers. The physical server\u2013based environment can be replicated to Azure using ASR. The same approach can be used for migration, where the replicated environment is failed over and then continues to run from Azure. An additional VM or physical machine should be available on-premise to set up the ASR components. Azure Backup does scheduled backup of VMs at specified time intervals to address the data and application resiliency concerns of environments hosted in Azure. If you have stringent recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs) defined in a business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) strategy, Azure Site Recovery (ASR) could be the better choice because it replicates data continuously to a different region in Azure. Note that this service is in preview at the time of writing this book. It is recommended to include ASR in the architecture to enable environment-level resiliency once the service becomes generally available. ASR for Azure VMs can be enabled directly from the Azure portal with minimal configuration steps. While Azure Backup requires the vault be in the same region as IaaS VMs, ASR mandates that to enable replication of IaaS VMs, the vault should be in a different region.

Azure Backup Vault Vs Site Recovery ... --- Body: What's the Difference? Azure Backup Vault Vs Site Recovery - Royal Discount What\u2019s the Difference? Azure Backup Vault Vs Site Recovery Azure Cloud, Cloud, Data Backup, Tips Business consistency needs vary from organization to organization. Larger IT organizations with heavier dependency on applications require more robust business consistency and disaster recovery. However, smaller, less dependent IT implementations may not need as intensive plans for data back-up and recovery as enterprise-class customers. Microsoft Azure provides two different models from which to choose with its recovery services \u00b7 Backup Vault or the newer Azure Recovery Services Vault \u00b7 Site Recovery Services The names of these two services suggest they cover the same needs, but they are different models. Backup Vault is used to perform backups that most organizations currently use. With Azure, the Backup Vault/Azure Recovery Services Vault replaces older technology with backup to the cloud. With Backup Vault more granular backup and restoration can be done down to individual files. Meanwhile, Site Recovery services is a different model for business recovery altogether. Site Recovery services replicates entire site data, physical servers, VMs and even network services. In this manner, an entire site has redundancy for high availability, failover and failback services. With a Site Recovery subscription, business consistency is achieved through replication either from an on-premise to cloud model or a cloud to cloud model. The distinction between Backup Vault and Site Recovery services is that, while both operate by storing data to the cloud for business consistency and disaster recovery, they achieve similar goals differently. Backup Vault uses the traditional method of backup but without the necessity of tape, using the Azure cloud instead. Site Recovery services achieves business consistency by site replication and failover/failback operations. Azure Backup Vault Azure Backup Vault is a backup solution most familiar to IT personnel where data is backed up so that it can be restored as necessary. The traditional method was to backup to tapes and send them off site. With Azure Backup Vault, tapes and tape drives are no longer necessary as data is backed up to the Azure cloud-based vault. Cost is reduced through the elimination of older equipment and the reduction of restoration time with backed up data always available. Backup Vault works as a cloud-to-cloud implementation where cloud-based VMs and data can be backed-up to the Backup Vault without disruption to services. Additionally, on-premise physical servers and VMs can\n", "messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello! How can I assist you today?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you help me understand difference between Azure Backup and Azure Site Recovery."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! Azure Backup and Azure Site Recovery are two different services offered by Microsoft Azure. \n\nAzure Backup is a service that allows you to back up your data to the Microsoft Azure Cloud.

For example, if you want to store keys and secrets, you work with the Microsoft.KeyVault resource provider. This resource provider offers a resource type called vaults for creating the key vault. The name of a resource type is in the format: {resource-provider}/{resource-type}. The resource type for a key vault is Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults. In this article, you learn how to: View all resource providers in Azure Check registration status of a resource provider Register a resource provider View resource types for a resource provider View valid locations for a resource type View valid API versions for a resource type You can do these steps through the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, or Azure CLI. For a list that maps resource providers to Azure services, see Resource providers for Azure services. Register resource provider Before using a resource provider, your Azure subscription must be registered for the resource provider. Registration configures your subscription to work with the resource provider. Important Only register a resource provider when you're ready to use it. The registration step enables you to maintain least privileges within your subscription. A malicious user can't use resource providers that aren't registered. Some resource providers are registered by default. For a list of resource providers registered by default, see Resource providers for Azure services. Other resource providers are registered automatically when you take certain actions. When you create a resource through the portal, the resource provider is typically registered for you. When you deploy an Azure Resource Manager template or Bicep file, resource providers defined in the template are registered automatically. However, if a resource in the template creates supporting resources that aren't in the template, such as monitoring or security resources, you need to manually register those resource providers. For other scenarios, you may need to manually register a resource provider. Important Your application code shouldn't block the creation of resources for a resource provider that is in the registering state. When you register the resource provider, the operation is done individually for each supported region.

The errors are displayed when you deploy resources with a Bicep file or Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template). If Azure doesn't automatically register a resource provider, you can do a manual registration. Symptom When a resource is deployed, you might receive the following error code and message: Output Copy Code: NoRegisteredProviderFound Message: No registered resource provider found for location {location} and API version {api-version} for type {resource-type}. Or, you might receive a similar message that states: Output Copy Code: MissingSubscriptionRegistration Message: The subscription is not registered to use namespace {resource-provider-namespace} The error message should give you suggestions for the supported locations and API versions. You can change your template to use a suggested value. Most providers are registered automatically by the Microsoft Azure portal or the command-line interface, but not all. If you haven't used a particular resource provider before, you might need to register that provider. When virtual machine (VM) auto-shutdown is disabled, you might receive an error message similar to: Output Copy Code: AuthorizationFailed Message: The client '<identifier>' with object id '<identifier>' does not have authorization to perform action 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/read' over scope ... An unexpected error can occur for a resource provider that's not in your ARM template or Bicep file. This error might happen when a resource is deployed that creates other supporting resources. For example, the resource in your template adds monitoring or security resources. The error message indicates the resource provider namespace you need to register is for the supporting resource. Cause You receive these errors for one of these reasons: The required resource provider hasn't been registered for your subscription. API version not supported for the resource type. Location not supported for the resource type. For VM auto-shutdown, the Microsoft.DevTestLab resource provider must be registered. Solution Azure CLI PowerShell Portal You can use Azure CLI to get information about a resource provider's registration status and register a resource provider. Use az provider list to display the registration status for your subscription's resource providers. The examples use the --output table parameter to filter the output for readability.

There can be various scenarios where the Resource Providers may not be registered in a subscription. When you create your subscription, not all Resource Providers are registered from the beginning. And if there are new Azure features added, the resource provider for that feature may not also be Registered as well. Also, when you are Owner or a Contributor to a subscription, when you create a resource that is not already Registered, the Resource Providers is automatically registered before the resource you requested is created. But if you do not have sufficient privileges then your resource will not be created and you will see an error message. There are 3 ways you can register Resource Providers in Azure. You can use either the Azure Portal, Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI to register Resource Providers. We will look at all 3 options. Using Azure Portal to Register a Resource Provider In Azure Portal it\u2019s really easy to register Resource Providers. All you have to do is to go to your Subscription blade (either by searching for \u2018Subscription\u2019 in the search bar or by clicking on the left navigation menu). Once in the Subscription blade, you can click on Resource Providers in the Settings section to see a list of available Resource Providers. Here you can see what Resource Providers are Register and what are not. To Register a Resource Provider in the Portal, simply click on the Register link in front of the Resource Provider you want to enable. It will take few minutes to complete, but once it does, the resource provider is registered and you can create the resources. Using Azure PowerShell to Register a Resource Provider It\u2019s quite easy to Register a resource provider using PowerShell. Login to your Azure Subscription and execute the following commands. # Login to Azure Subscription Login-AzureRmAccount# Check the registration Status of the Resource Provider Get-AzureRmResourceProvider-ListAvailable |Where-Object{$_.ProviderNamespace -eq \"Microsoft.Compute\"}# Register the Microsoft.Compute Resource Provider Register-AzureRmResourceProvider-ProviderNamespace \"Microsoft.Compute\" I want to enable Microsoft.Compute Resource Provider in this example, and using the Get-AzureRmResourceProvider command I am listing the available resource and filtering the list only to show the\n[4]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/resources/provider-resource-types/list --- Title: Provider Resource Types - List - docs.microsoft.com --- Body: Provider Resource Types - List - REST API (Azure Resource Management) | Microsoft Docs Docs Resource Management Provider Resource Types Provider Resource Types - List Reference Service: Resource Management API Version: 2021-04-01 List the resource types for a specified resource provider.

Enhanced management and deployment: ARM provides a more modern and flexible way to manage and deploy resources in Azure. It introduces resource groups that allow you to logically organize related resources, simplifying management and providing better visibility and control over your deployment.\n\n2. Role-based access control (RBAC): ARM includes RBAC, which allows you to assign granular permissions to users or groups for specific resources or resource groups. This helps ensure that only authorized individuals can access or modify resources, improving security and compliance.\n\n3. Template-based deployment: ARM uses templates, referred to as ARM templates, to define and deploy resources. These templates are declarative and allow for consistent, repeatable deployment, making it easier to manage infrastructure as code. They can also be version-controlled, providing better traceability and enabling automation of the deployment process.\n\n4. Support for tagging: ARM introduces the concept of tags, which are key-value pairs that you can assign to resources. Tags provide a flexible way to categorize and organize resources, making it easier to manage and track costs, compliance, and operations.\n\n5. Integration with Azure services: ARM is tightly integrated with other Azure services, allowing you to take advantage of the latest features and capabilities. For example, you can use ARM to deploy and manage services like Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps, and Azure App Service.\n\nOverall, ARM provides a more modern and efficient way to manage and deploy resources in Azure, offering improved control, flexibility, and integration with other Azure services."}], "topic": "azure classic to arm migration"}, {"_id": "65c8ffd5f174b28977037654", "ref_url": "[1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth-ropc \n[2]: https://reddit.com/r/azure/comments/k8sig6/seeing_user_agent_bav2ropc \n[3]: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/identity-authentication/why-are-microsoft-data-centres-logging-in-to-my-office-365/td-p/1139179 \n[4]: https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2287595-office-365-bav2ropc-sign-in \n[5]: https://microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/10/26/protect-your-business-from-password-sprays-with-microsoft-dart-recommendations \n", "openai_model": "gpt-35-turbo-16k", "dialogue_version": 1, "ref": "\n\nSources:\n[1]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth-ropc --- Title: Sign in with resource owner \ue000password\ue001 credentials grant ... --- Body: Sign in with resource owner password credentials grant - Microsoft identity platform | Microsoft Docs Azure Active Directory Develop Microsoft identity platform and OAuth 2.0 Resource Owner Password Credentials Article 02/18/2022 4 minutes to read 15 contributors In this article Protocol diagram Authorization request Learn more The Microsoft identity platform supports the OAuth 2.0 Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC) grant, which allows an application to sign in the user by directly handling their password. This article describes how to program directly against the protocol in your application. When possible, we recommend you use the supported Microsoft Authentication Libraries (MSAL) instead to acquire tokens and call secured web APIs. Also take a look at the sample apps that use MSAL. Warning Microsoft recommends you do not use the ROPC flow. In most scenarios, more secure alternatives are available and recommended. This flow requires a very high degree of trust in the application, and carries risks which are not present in other flows. You should only use this flow when other more secure flows can't be used. Important The Microsoft identity platform only supports ROPC within Azure AD tenants, not personal accounts. This means that you must use a tenant-specific endpoint (https://login.microsoftonline.com/{TenantId_or_Name}) or the organizations endpoint. Personal accounts that are invited to an Azure AD tenant can't use ROPC. Accounts that don't have passwords can't sign in with ROPC, which means features like SMS sign-in, FIDO, and the Authenticator app won't work with that flow. Use a flow other than ROPC if your app or users require these features. If users need to use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to log in to the application, they will be blocked instead. ROPC is not supported in hybrid identity federation scenarios (for example, Azure AD and ADFS used to authenticate on-premises accounts). If users are full-page redirected to an on-premises identity providers, Azure AD is not able to test the username and password against that identity provider. Pass-through authentication is supported with ROPC, however. An exception to a hybrid identity federation scenario would be the following: Home Realm Discovery policy with AllowCloudPasswordValidation set to TRUE will enable ROPC flow to work for federated users when on-premises password is synced to cloud. For more information, see Enable direct ROPC authentication of federated users for legacy applications. Tip Try executing this request and more in Postman -- don't forget to replace tokens and IDs!

Activity Alerts - BAV2ROPC Hello, I have an activity alert set up to email me whenever a log in is detected from one of my 12 office 365 email users. These emails contain the username logging in and the IP address the log in originated from. Until the end of 2019, all IP addresses were expected, either being that of the office, the Vodafone mobile network or the home addresses of the sales guys. In 2020, I have started getting log in alerts, which according to https://whatismyipaddress.com/ are from Microsoft Datacentres in Ireland, Holland and Austria, all with \"Microsoft Corporation\" as the ISP and sometimes with the same for the Organisation and sometimes with \"Microsoft Azure\". e.g 40.101.88.221 (Amsterdam), 40.101.102.149 (Dublin). Worried about potential breaches, I contacted Microsoft Support (who by the way are always ON IT, thank you) who helped me find info in the audit log to say the User Agent is BAV2ROPC, which lead me to this page https://www.reddit.com/r/Office365/comments/bl90gw/bav2ropc_user_agent_in_logs/ where someone's found it means \"Business Apps v2 Resource Owner Password Credential\", which is apparently the User Agent for an updated version of Outlook Mobile.

I have not received texts in relation to these logins, so again I don't think it's a breach. 3) I don't use Microsoft Outlook on my mobile, so don't think I'd be generating this BAV2ROPC user agent (but I am on the Activity Alerts). 4) If it was a device I was using\n[4]: URL: https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2287595-office-365-bav2ropc-sign-in --- Title: Office 365 BAV2ROPC Sign in - Spiceworks --- Body: Office 365 BAV2ROPC Sign in Home Office 365 BAV2ROPC Sign in Posted by CarlosTech on Sep 8th, 2020 at 10:22 AM Needs answer Microsoft Office 365 Microsoft Azure Sup Spiceheads!

This threat is a moving target with techniques and tools always changing, and Microsoft continues to find new ways to detect these types of attacks and help protect its customers. In this blog, we are going to define what password sprays are, detail DART\u2019s investigation techniques and approach to responding to password spray attacks, and outline our recommendations for protecting against them. Why are identity-based attacks suddenly so popular? Previously, threat actors focused on attacking computers to gain access into an environment. As software becomes more intelligent at detecting abnormal programs and vulnerabilities, attacks against our customers are rapidly becoming more focused on breaking into identities rather than breaking into a network. The approach to securing user accounts is well-intentioned, but it is often incomplete, with a large investment that typically goes into areas such as complex password policies and limiting access to resources from networks perceived as secure. While these mitigations are necessary best practices, in the case of a compromised trusted user, they are ineffective at preventing unauthorized access. This is why identity attacks have become so popular. Once attackers have gained the credentials to an account, they can access any sensitive resources that users can access and have the malicious activity appear as normal. This creates a repeating cycle attack pattern, where one compromised account can lead to access to resources where additional credentials can be harvested, and thus even further resource access. Figure 1. Identity-based attack lifecycle. The anatomy of a password spray attack To understand how to protect against, and investigate a password spray attack, it is important to understand what it is. Password spray attacks are authentication attacks that employ a large list of usernames and pair them with common passwords in an attempt to \u201cguess\u201d the correct combination for as many users as possible. These are different from brute-force attacks, which involve attackers using a custom dictionary or wordlist and attempting to attack a small number of user accounts.

Even better if the app is .NET Core + EF Core based. On paper Azure PostgreSQL should be cheaper because of the licensing, and I've seen recommendations to choose it over Azure SQL. But the latter is obviously what MS wants everyone to use and it enjoys first-class treatment throughout the MS eco system.

Article 02/14/2022 2 minutes to read 8 contributors In this article Policy enforcement Next steps With Conditional Access policies, you can specify access requirements to websites and services. For example, your access requirements can include requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA) or managed devices. When you access a site or service directly, the impact of a related policy is typically easy to assess. For example, if you have a policy that requires multi-factor authentication (MFA) for SharePoint Online configured, MFA is enforced for each sign-in to the SharePoint web portal. However, it isn't always straight-forward to assess the impact of a policy because there are cloud apps with dependencies to other cloud apps. For example, Microsoft Teams can provide access to resources in SharePoint Online. So, when you access Microsoft Teams in our current scenario, you're also subject to the SharePoint MFA policy. Tip Using the Office 365 app will target all Office apps to avoid issues with service dependencies in the Office stack. Policy enforcement If you have a service dependency configured, the policy may be applied using early-bound or late-bound enforcement. Early-bound policy enforcement means a user must satisfy the dependent service policy before accessing the calling app. For example, a user must satisfy SharePoint policy before signing into MS Teams. Late-bound policy enforcement occurs after the user signs into the calling app. Enforcement is deferred to when calling app requests, a token for the downstream service. Examples include MS Teams accessing Planner and Office.com accessing SharePoint. The diagram below illustrates MS Teams service dependencies. Solid arrows indicate early-bound enforcement the dashed arrow for Planner indicates late-bound enforcement. As a best practice, you should set common policies across related apps and services whenever possible. Having a consistent security posture provides you with the best user experience. For example, setting a common policy across Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, Microsoft Teams, and Skype for business significantly reduces unexpected prompts that may arise from different policies being applied to downstream services. A great way to accomplish a common policy with applications in the Office stack is to use the Office 365 app instead of targeting individual applications. The below table lists some more service dependencies, where the client apps must satisfy. This list isn't exhaustive.

Why are some tabs not working in Microsoft Teams after enabling Conditional Access policies? Next steps Which applications work with Conditional Access policies? For information about applications that work with Conditional Access policies, see Applications and browsers that use Conditional Access rules in Azure Active Directory. Are Conditional Access policies enforced for B2B collaboration and guest users? Policies are enforced for business-to-business (B2B) collaboration users. However, in some cases, a user might not be able to satisfy the policy requirements. For example, a guest user's organization might not support multi-factor authentication. Does a SharePoint Online policy also apply to OneDrive for Business? Yes. A SharePoint Online policy also applies to OneDrive for Business. For more information, see the article, Conditional Access service dependencies and consider targeting policies to the Office 365 app instead. Why can\u2019t I set a policy directly on client apps, like Word or Outlook? A Conditional Access policy sets requirements for accessing a service. It's enforced when authentication to that service occurs. The policy is not set directly on a client application. Instead, it is applied when a client calls a service. For example, a policy set on SharePoint applies to clients calling SharePoint. A policy set on Exchange applies to Outlook. For more information, see the article, Conditional Access service dependencies and consider targeting policies to the Office 365 app instead. Does a Conditional Access policy apply to service accounts? Conditional Access policies apply to all user accounts. This includes user accounts that are used as service accounts. Often, a service account that runs unattended can't satisfy the requirements of a Conditional Access policy. For example, multi-factor authentication might be required. Service accounts can be excluded from a policy by using a user or group exclusion.

By Alex Simons (AZURE) Published Feb 04 2020 09:00 AM 45.2K Views Skip to footer content Howdy folks, Today, I\u2019m super excited to announce the public preview of Conditional Access for the Office 365 suite. For organizations setting policy on Office 365\u2014such as requiring users to perform Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or have managed devices\u2014of Conditional Access for the Office 365 suite makes the configuration a whole lot easier. Hundreds of millions of people use the Office 365 apps like SharePoint Online, Exchange Online, and Microsoft Teams. Part of what makes these services work so well is they interact with each other and a have a collection of supporting services. There are tons of benefits of integration\u2014one example is shared contact information in Exchange for SharePoint and Teams. In many ways, even though Office 365 is composed of many cooperating services, it functions as a single app to help your users be productive. Conditional Access can be used to protect all Azure AD connected apps, including thousands of pre-integrated SaaS apps, apps your organization has developed, as well as hybrid apps accessed through the Azure Application Proxy. However, because of the close relationship between Office services it makes sense to help you target Office 365 as a single app with Azure AD Conditional Access policies. Many of you have asked for this capability, and we worked with several customers to make sure we got the feature right. Conditional Access for the Office 365 suite gives admins the option to assign policy across Office 365 with one click. It provides consistent coverage and improves the user experience by setting a consistent policy across Office 365 apps. Assigning different policies to different services can result in unexpected interrupts as users access data that requires service to service interaction. To learn more about this topic, see our Conditional Access service dependencies documentation. You can also enforce policy to apps that aren\u2019t available in the Conditional Access app list, like the Office.com portal. See the complete list of individual apps included in the Conditional Access for the Office 365 suite.

After it's fully built, it gets composed to an IServiceProvider instance which you can use to resolve services. You can inject an IServiceProvider into any class. The IApplicationBuilder and HttpContext classes can provide the service provider as well, via their ApplicationServices or RequestServices properties respectively. IServiceProvider defines a GetService(Type type) method to resolve a service: var service = (IFooService)serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(IFooService)); There are also several convenience extension methods available, such as serviceProvider.GetService<IFooService>() (add a using for Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection ). Resolving services inside the startup class Injecting dependencies The runtime's hosting service provider can inject certain services into the constructor of the Startup class, such as IConfiguration , IWebHostEnvironment (IHostingEnvironment in pre-3.0 versions), ILoggerFactory and IServiceProvider. Note that the latter is an instance built by the hosting layer and contains only the essential services for starting up an application. The ConfigureServices() method does not allow injecting services, it only accepts an IServiceCollection argument. This makes sense because ConfigureServices() is where you register the services required by your application. However you can use services injected in the startup's constructor here, for example: public Startup(IConfiguration\n", "messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!

The OS disk will get the name of the VM as provided by you during the creation of the VM. You can refer to this link to find more details. I did a test and reproduced the same error as yours. Because I changed the OS disk name with Set-AzureRmVMOSDisk. Then I deleted the cmdlet which changed the OS disk\u2019s name and succeed. You can refer to create the vm without changing the OS disk name like the following cmdlet: $VirtualMachine = Set-AzureRmVMOSDisk -VM $VirtualMachine -ManagedDiskId $disk.Id -CreateOption Attach -Windows The whole powershell cmdlet I used : #Provide the subscription Id $subscriptionId = 'xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx' $resourceGroupName ='yangsatest' $diskName = 'VM1_OsDisk_1_xxxxxxxxxxxx' $location = 'eastus' $virtualNetworkName = 'yangsatest-vnet' $virtualMachineName = 'VM2' $virtualMachineSize = 'Standard_A1' Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionId $SubscriptionId $disk = Get-AzureRmDisk -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -DiskName $diskName $VirtualMachine = New-AzureRmVMConfig -VMName $virtualMachineName -VMSize $virtualMachineSize -AvailabilitySetId /subscriptions/xxxxx-xxxxxx-xxx-xxxx8-xxxxxx/resourceGroups/yangsatest/providers/Microsoft.Compute/availabilitySets/Myset #Use the Managed Disk Resource Id to attach it to the virtual machine.

The examples help you to update existing templates that are using unmanaged Disks to managed disks. For reference, we are using the vm-simple-windows template as a guide. You can see the template using both managed Disks and a prior version using unmanaged disks if you'd like to directly compare them. Unmanaged Disks template formatting To begin, let's take a look at how unmanaged disks are deployed. When creating unmanaged disks, you need a storage account to hold the VHD files. You can create a new storage account or use one that already exists. This article shows you how to create a new storage account. Create a storage account resource in the resources block as shown below. JSON Copy { \"type\": \"Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts\", \"apiVersion\": \"2018-07-01\", \"name\": \"[variables('storageAccountName')]\", \"location\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\", \"sku\": { \"name\": \"Standard_LRS\"}, \"kind\": \"Storage\", \"properties\": {} } Within the virtual machine object, add a dependency on the storage account to ensure that it's created before the virtual machine. Within the storageProfile section, specify the full URI of the VHD location, which references the storage account and is needed for the OS disk and any data disks. JSON Copy { \"type\": \"Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines\", \"apiVersion\": \"2018-10-01\", \"name\": \"[variables('vmName')]\", \"location\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\", \"dependsOn\": [ \"[resourceId('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/', variables('storageAccountName'))]\", \"[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/', variables('nicName'))]\"], \"properties\": { \"hardwareProfile\": {...}, \"osProfile\": {...}, \"storageProfile\": { \"imageReference\": { \"publisher\": \"MicrosoftWindowsServer\", \"offer\": \"WindowsServer\", \"sku\": \"[parameters('windowsOSVersion')]\", \"version\": \"latest\"}, \"osDisk\": { \"name\": \"osdisk\", \"vhd\": { \"uri\": \"[concat(reference(resourceId('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/', variables('storageAccountName'))).primaryEndpoints.blob, 'vhds/osdisk.vhd')]\"}, \"caching\": \"ReadWrite\", \"createOption\": \"FromImage\"}, \"dataDisks\": [ { \"name\": \"datadisk1\", \"diskSizeGB\": 1023, \"lun\": 0, \"vhd\": { \"uri\": \"[concat(reference(resourceId('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/', variables('storageAccountName'))).primaryEndpoints.blob, 'vhds/datadisk1.vhd')]\"}, \"createOption\": \"Empty\"} ] }, \"networkProfile\": {...}, \"diagnosticsProfile\": {...} } } Managed disks template formatting With Azure Managed Disks, the disk becomes a top-level resource and no longer requires a storage account to be created by the user.

For databases, Azure offers solutions for relational database management systems (RDBMS), as well as big data workloads. RDBMS use cases include online transaction processing (OLTP) and online analytical processing (OLAP). For big data workloads, Azure offers solutions like key-value storage, as well as real-time and batch processing. In this post, we\u2019ll provide a comprehensive overview of the various database services offered on Azure, and show how NetApp Cloud Volumes ONTAP can help simplify Azure database migration and management.

In this article, you will learn: Database Workloads in Azure Online analytical processing (OLAP) in Azure Online transaction processing (OLTP) in Azure Non-relational databases in Azure Azure database services Services for Azure database migration Simplifying Azure databases with Cloud Volumes ONTAP Database Workloads in Azure: RDBMS vs Big Data As the popularity of the cloud increases, the way applications are designed is changing and so is the way that data is processed and stored. Today, many solutions use multiple specialized data stores instead of the general-purpose databases of the past. These solutions work through data pipelines, automating where data is stored, how it is processed, and by which tools it is ingested. These changes have enabled users to move data workloads from traditional relational database management system (RDBMS) models to big data models. RDBMS workloads RDBMS workloads employ online transaction processing (OLTP) and online analytical processing (OLAP) methods. OLTP is used to support transaction-oriented applications. OLAP enables you to analyze data from multiple databases at once. In combination, these methods enable you to use extract, transform, load (ETL) processes to aggregate and leverage data. Big data workloads Big data workloads involve volumes of data that have one or more of these characteristics: Too large or complex for traditional database methods Needs to be processed in real-time or batches Unstructured or semi-structured data such as JSON files, time series data, or key-value data OLAP in Azure When using RDBMS workloads in Azure, your data is copied from OLTP systems to OLAP systems.

Since this is my first time working on the real estate domain, I would like to pick a database that would be efficient in the long run.

Introduction Microsoft Azure platform provides a range of options to host database servers on the Azure platform in an Infrastructure-as-a-service, Platform-as-a-Service, and Software-as-a-service option. Examples of different database products offered on the Azure platform are SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, CosmosDB, Cassandra, and others. PostgreSQL is one of the most popular open-source database servers used in the industry and is available on the Azure platform in a PaaS model through the service Azure Database for PostgreSQL. To date, the most common option to deploy PostgreSQL on the Azure platform has been the Single Server option. Using this model one can deploy a PostgreSQL Server with typical settings that are used or required for a transactional system. This option is suitable where the requirements for customization of the database server are minimal. This option offers the typical capabilities of high availability, disaster recovery, managed storage, etc. But often this does not eliminate the need to customize, optimize or fine-tune the database server settings to suit the needs of the application or business to which the database server caters. As of the draft of this article, Azure recently launched a new model of Azure Database for PostgreSQL \u2013 Flexible server, which allows a great deal of customization than the Single Server option, which is typically considered to be a start-up option when the development environments or sandbox environment are created. By the time database servers are moved to production or after the database has been deployed for a reasonable duration in production, one may need to customize it and that\u2019s when the Flexible server deployment model may step in. In this article, we will learn how to create a Flexible server model of Azure Database for PostgreSQL and also understand the unique features associated with it. Deploying Azure Database for PostgreSQL \u2013 Flexible server Model As the name suggests, the Flexible server model provides much more configuration or customization settings for database server management and operations than the single server model. Some unique features include the ability to deploy the server in multiple availability zones, cost optimization options which include\n", "messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!

Using such programs has become an essential need rather than an auxiliary service in the last years. They provide security and ensure an efficient development process, make it easier to implement innovations, and optimize existing applications and web-sites in Azure cloud tools. To decide on the solution fitting your best experimentally, you would have to spend hours comparing ARM Templates vs Terraform. Fortunately, we already did it for you, so keep on reading to save yourself some effort! Image source: build5nines.com Firstly, what is Terraform? It is an \u201cInfrastructure as Code\u201d instrument that is currently the main topic of discussion. In essence, it is a proprietary language that supports multi-channel work with several cloud platforms at once, allowing you to keep track of all the applications with just one service. ARM templates are designed to deploy resources only in Azure. But it is a Microsoft trademark product, which speaks volumes about its high quality. From 99.95% availability of corporate applications to an undeniable level of security. You can roll out your infrastructure in a single declaration template. Moreover, it is flexible for all stages and environments including testing, intermediate, and operational. Azure Terraform vs ARM Templates: Advantages Since Terraform is a relatively recent tool, let's look if it has to offer something more than the usual ARM templates. As we've already mentioned, one of the main advantages of Terraform is its language uniformity, allowing it to work with Azure, AWS, GCE, OpenStack, and local deployments on a single hardware. You can apply a cloud server deployment scenario to one and add a DNS record to another cloud service provider. Changing your cloud provider will not be a problem if you learn the HCL language. This is a definite advantage for developers who have implemented AWS, GCP, and Azure in their work environment. The powerful HCL interpolation syntax allows referencing variables, attributes, and so on. In combination with the IDE plugin, this will greatly enhance your programming process.

Zachary D November 24th, 2020 Infrastructure as code has transformed the way we build and manage our applications, and cloud hosting has paved the way by giving us the power to spin up and tear down entire environments nearly instantly with only a few keystrokes at the command line. There are many tools that can help tackle infrastructure as code and they range from cloud-specific tools like Azure Resource Manager Templates to open-source cloud or host agnostic tools like HashiCorp Terraform. Which is right for you? What are you using now? If you haven\u2019t already looked into infrastructure as code, there is no better time than now. Infrastructure as code fits seamlessly into the CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) portion of DevOps. Leveraging infrastructure as code gives your operations and engineering teams the ability to adopt DevOps best practices by allowing them to focus on reliably and consistently delivering value to your end-users. If you\u2019re an Azure customer, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ve already heard of or have looked at ARM Templates for automating some piece of your infrastructure. If you\u2019re not an Azure customer, you may have looked at similar offerings that are specific to your cloud hosting provider. Offerings like ARM Templates or cloud-specific infrastructure as code tools work to deploy and manage infrastructure exclusively on the cloud hosting provider they were built for. If you want to have your infrastructure span several cloud providers or platforms using these tools alone, you will need to work with each tool from each provider \u2013 and each cloud provider\u2019s tooling will use different syntax and verbiage. This is where cloud or host agnostic tools like HashiCorp Terraform can really make life easier working across clouds as well as on-premises environments. ARM Templates vs HashiCorp Terraform Infrastructure as code at its very heart is declaring what services or infrastructure you want by means of code \u2013 much in the same way a developer writes code for an application. ARM stands for Azure Resource Manager, and an ARM Template allows you to define resources that you\u2019d like to stand up or manage within Azure. You can use an ARM template to manage all resources from an entire Resource Group, or you can manage one or more resources within a Resource Group\n[3]: URL: https://lemagit.fr/conseil/iac-les-differences-entre-les-templates-arm-et-terraform --- Title: IaC : les diff\u00e9rences entre les templates ARM et Terraform --- Body: IaC : les diff\u00e9rences entre les templates ARM et Terraform taa22 - stock.adobe.com taa22 - stock.adobe.com Conseil IaC : les diff\u00e9rences entre les templates ARM et Terraform Les templates ARM et Terraform sont des fichiers populaires dans le cadre d'une configuration d'une infrastructure as code.

Check out an Ubuntu Server VM example in each approach and learn the pros and cons of these tools. By Adam Bertram Published: 28 Jun 2021 Infrastructure as code is the practice by which IT admins document the infrastructure configuration for an application or service in a template. Although the concept is far from new, tools have improved dramatically in quality, especially for use with cloud providers like Microsoft Azure. Two of the most popular infrastructure-as-code tools to use with Azure are the native Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates and HashiCorp Terraform. Azure users should compare ARM templates vs. the Terraform approach to decide which product is the better fit for their environment. Follow along with these examples of ARM and Terraform, then explore pros and cons that come with these infrastructure-as-code (sometimes called IaC) tools. Prerequisites To get started evaluating ARM templates and Terraform, install the following on your machine: Microsoft Visual Studio Code and the Azure Resource Manager Template Extension for Visual Studio Code; Terraform and Azure PowerShell -- the Azure Cloud Shell interactive shell has both pre-installed; and A Microsoft Azure account. Azure Resource Manager templates ARM templates are JSON documents that define each aspect of the IT infrastructure. For example, a compute resource for a new VM includes its size, credentials, version and attached storage all defined in the same JSON file. Below is an example ARM template for an Ubuntu Server VM: # JSON ... { \"name\": \"ubuntuVM1\", \"type\": \"Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines\", \"apiVersion\": \"2019-07-01\", \"location\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\", \"properties\": { \"hardwareProfile\": { \"vmSize\": \"Standard_A2_v2\" }, \"osProfile\": { \"computerName\": \"ubuntuVM1\", \"adminUsername\": \"adminUsername\", \"adminPassword\": \"adminPassword123\" }, \"storageProfile\": { \"imageReference\": { \"publisher\": \"Canonical\", \"offer\": \"UbuntuServer\", \"sku\": \"16.04-LTS\", \"version\": \"latest\" }, \"osDisk\": { \"name\": \"ubuntuVM1-OSDisk\", \"caching\": \"ReadWrite\", \"createOption\": \"FromImage\" } }, ... IT admins who are familiar with JSON formatting will find this template input familiar: Microsoft has a well-defined schema that enables easy ARM template creation in Visual Studio Code. Open a new JSON document and type arm and you can generate a new blank template to which you can add resources. TechTarget Figure 1. Add 'arm' to a JSON document in the Visual Studio Code terminal.

Options for adding RBAC to apps Choosing an approach Next steps Role-based access control (RBAC) allows certain users or groups to have specific permissions regarding which resources they have access to, what they can do with those resources, and who manages which resources. Application role-based access control differs from Azure role-based access control and Azure AD role-based access control. Azure custom roles and built-in roles are both part of Azure RBAC, which helps you manage Azure resources. Azure AD RBAC allows you to manage Azure AD resources. This article explains application-specific role-based access control. What are roles? Role-based access control (RBAC) is a popular mechanism to enforce authorization in applications. When using RBAC, an application developer defines roles rather than authorizing individual users or groups. An administrator can then assign roles to different users and groups to control who has access to what content and functionality. RBAC helps you, as an app developer, manage resources and what users can do with those resources. RBAC also allows an app developer to control what areas of an app users have access to. While admins can control which users have access to an app using the User assignment required property, developers need to account for specific users within the app and what users can do within the app. As an app developer, you need to first create a role definition within the app\u2019s registration section in the Azure AD admin center. The role definition includes a value that is returned for users who are assigned to that role. A developer can then use this value to implement application logic to determine what those users can or can't do in an application. Options for adding RBAC to apps There are several considerations that must be managed when including role-based access control authorization in an application. These include: Defining the roles that are required by an application\u2019s authorization needs. Applying, storing, and retrieving the pertinent roles for authenticated users. Affecting the desired application behavior based on the roles assigned to the current user. Once you define the roles, the Microsoft identity platform supports several different solutions that can be used to apply, store, and retrieve role\n[4]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-authentication-authorization --- Title: Authentication and authorization - Azure App Service ... --- Body: Authentication and authorization - Azure App Service | Microsoft Docs Azure App Service Web Apps Authentication and authorization in Azure App Service and Azure Functions Article 11/23/2021 8 minutes to read 18 contributors In this article Why use the built-in authentication? Identity providers Considerations for using built-in authentication How it works More resources Azure App Service provides built-in authentication and authorization capabilities (sometimes referred to as \"Easy Auth\"), so you can sign in users and access data by writing minimal or no code in your web app, RESTful API, and mobile back end, and also Azure Functions. This article describes how App Service helps simplify authentication and authorization for your app. Why use the built-in authentication? You're not required to use this feature for authentication and authorization. You can use the bundled security features in your web framework of choice, or you can write your own utilities. However, you will need to ensure that your solution stays up to date with the latest security, protocol, and browser updates. Implementing a secure solution for authentication (signing-in users) and authorization (providing access to secure data) can take significant effort. You must make sure to follow industry best practices and standards, and keep your implementation up to date. The built-in authentication feature for App Service and Azure Functions can save you time and effort by providing out-of-the-box authentication with federated identity providers, allowing you to focus on the rest of your application. Azure App Service allows you to integrate a variety of auth capabilities into your web app or API without implementing them yourself. It\u2019s built directly into the platform and doesn\u2019t require any particular language, SDK, security expertise, or even any code to utilize. You can integrate with multiple login providers. For example, Azure AD, Facebook, Google, Twitter. Identity providers App Service uses federated identity, in which a third-party identity provider manages the user identities and authentication flow for you. The following identity providers are available by default: Provider Sign-in endpoint How-To guidance Microsoft Identity Platform /.auth/login/aad App Service Microsoft Identity Platform login Facebook /.auth/login/facebook App Service Facebook login Google /.auth/login/google App Service Google login Twitter /.auth/login/twitter App Service Twitter login Any OpenID Connect provider /.auth/login/<providerName> App Service OpenID Connect login When you enable authentication and authorization with one of these providers, its sign-in endpoint is available for user authentication and for validation of authentication tokens from the provider.

But when I\u2019m talking to developers, operations engineers, and other Azure customers, I often find that there is some confusion and uncertainty about what they do. In this post I will explain what MSIs are and are not, where they make sense to use, and give some general advice on how to work with them. What Do Managed Service Identities Do? A managed service identity allows an Azure resource to identify itself to Azure Active Directory without needing to present any explicit credentials. Let\u2019s explain that a little more. In many situations, you may have Azure resources that need to securely communicate with other resources. For example, you may have an application running on Azure App Service that needs to retrieve some secrets from a Key Vault. Before MSIs existed, you would need to create an identity for the application in Azure AD, set up credentials for that application (also known as creating a service principal ), configure the application to know these credentials, and then communicate with Azure AD to exchange the credentials for a short-lived token that Key Vault will accept. This requires quite a lot of upfront setup, and can be difficult to achieve within a fully automated deployment pipeline. Additionally, to maintain a high level of security, the credentials should be changed (rotated) regularly, and this requires even more manual effort. With an MSI, in contrast, the App Service automatically gets its own identity in Azure AD, and there is a built-in way that the app can use its identity to retrieve a token. We don\u2019t need to maintain any AD applications, create any credentials, or handle the rotation of these credentials ourselves. Azure takes care of it for us. It can do this because Azure can identify the resource \u2013 it already knows where a given App Service or virtual machine \u2018lives\u2019 inside the Azure environment, so it can use this information to allow the application to identify itself to Azure AD without the need for exchanging credentials. What Do Managed Service Identities Not Do? Inbound requests: One of the biggest points of confusion about MSIs is whether they are used for inbound requests\n", "messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!

Azure AD is the identity provider that authenticates users and provides access tokens to them. These tokens can be used to access secure resources and services within Azure."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you list down the steps to do the same?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! Here are the general steps to retrieve security tokens from Azure Active Directory:\n\n1. Register your application in Azure AD: You need to register your application in Azure AD to obtain a unique client ID and configure authentication settings.\n\n2. Authenticate the user: To retrieve security tokens, your application should first authenticate the user. This can be done using various authentication protocols such as OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect.\n\n3. Request access tokens: Once the user is authenticated, your application can request access tokens from Azure AD. These tokens are used to access specific resources or services within Azure.\n\n4. Use the access tokens: Once your application receives the access tokens, it can include them in the authorization headers of API requests to access the secured resources or services in Azure.\n\nIt's important to note that the exact steps might vary depending on the programming language and SDKs you are using.

You can either use the default SQL Server 2019 Express LocalDB installed with Azure AD Connect or use your own full SQL. SQL Server Express imposes a 10-GB size limit. When using LocalDB and this limit is reached, Azure AD Connect Synchronization Service can no longer start or synchronize properly. This article provides the recovery steps. Symptoms There are two common symptoms: Azure AD Connect Synchronization Service is running but fails to synchronize with \u201cstopped-database-disk-full\u201d error. Azure AD Connect Synchronization Service is unable to start. When you attempt to start the service, it fails with event 6323 and error message \"The server encountered an error because SQL Server is out of disk space.\" Short-term recovery steps This section provides the steps to reclaim DB space required for Azure AD Connect Synchronization Service to resume operation. The steps include: Determine the Synchronization Service status Shrink the database Delete run history data Shorten retention period for run history data Determine the Synchronization Service status First, determine whether the Synchronization Service is still running or not: Log in to your Azure AD Connect server as administrator. Go to Service Control Manager. Check the status of Microsoft Azure AD Sync. If it is running, do not stop or restart the service. Skip Shrink the database step and go to Delete run history data step. If it is not running, try to start the service. If the service starts successfully, skip Shrink the database step and go to Delete run history data step. Otherwise, continue with Shrink the database step. Shrink the database Use the Shrink operation to free up enough DB space to start the Synchronization Service. It frees up DB space by removing whitespaces in the database. This step is best-effort as it is not guaranteed that you can always recover space. To learn more about Shrink operation, read this article Shrink a database. Important Skip this step if you can get the Synchronization Service to run. It is not recommended to shrink the SQL DB as it\n", "messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!

Original product version: Configuration Manager (current branch), Microsoft System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager, Microsoft System Center 2012 Configuration Manager Original KB number: 4468601 Introduction Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) boot in System Center 2012 Configuration Manager (ConfigMgr 2012 or ConfigMgr 2012 R2) and later versions enables administrators to easily access the Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE) across the network via PXE. PXE is an industry standard created by Intel that provides pre-boot services within the devices firmware that enables devices to download network boot programs to client computers. Configuration Manager relies on the Windows Deployment Services (WDS) server role via the WDS PXE provider. In ConfigMgr 2012 and later versions, the SMS PXE provider (SMSPXE) registers with the WDS service and supplies the logic for the PXE client requests. Before troubleshooting PXE-related problems in Configuration Manager, it's important to understand the basic processes involved, how they work and how they interoperate with each other. In all instances in this document, we are using System Center 2012 Configuration Manager R2 Cumulative Update 2 (ConfigMgr 2012 R2 CU2) and a remote site system installed on Windows Server 2012 with the Distribution Point (DP) role installed. PXE service point installation We will first look at the processes involved in the installation of the SMSPXE provider. Installation is initiated by selecting the Enable PXE support for clients option on the PXE tab in Distribution point properties. When PXE support is enabled, an instance of SMS_SCI_SysResUse class is created.

Have you ever wanted to boot to WinPE in Azure and select an Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) Task Sequence? As part of an informal cloud-readiness evaluation, I was asked to deploy a server image to Azure. The image that I was given would run the MDT Deployment Wizard to allow for the selection of deployment options. But, how could I choose deployment options if I could not reach the Azure virtual machine in the boot environment? Read on to find out how to interact with an Azure virtual machine in a preboot environment! Introduction Plenty of moving pieces need to be precisely configured as part of the process. The following diagram describes the relationship of the components and visualizes the required configurations. Before you begin, ensure that you have met all the system requirements. System requirements Install MDT and WADK as usual with default values. Ensure that you have proper operating system installation media. Use Volume Licensed images if possible.

It\u2019s used to create a custom VHD. Track down the install bits for the Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset (DaRT), which is part of the Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack (MDOP) and requires a Visual Studio subscription or Software Assurance. Because the MDOP requires Software Assurance to use legally, I cannot provide a direct link. DaRT is used to interact with the WinPE console remotely to complete the Task Sequence Wizard in Azure. Task sequence modifications Through the process of elimination, I discovered that many of the default steps in a Server Deployment Task Sequence end up breaking a virtual machine deployment in Azure. The following steps can be removed or disabled to ensure proper deployment: \u201cPreinstall \u2013 New Computer Only \u2013 Format and Partition Disk\u201d \u201cPreinstall \u2013 Inject Drivers\u201d \u201cPostinstall \u2013 Add Windows Recover (WinRE)\u201d Now there are steps to add to get DaRT integrated with your task sequence: In the Install \u2013 Install Operating System step, specify the partition to install the operating system.

Unfortunately, for now Azure does not support this. If our windows OS MBR is destroyed or other issues that block the VM from booting, to fix this problem, we should download this VM's VHD to local, and use Hyper-V to fix it with ISO file. After completed, we should upload this new VHD to Azure storage account, and use this new VHD to create Azure VM (create it with existing Vnet and public IP address, just replace this VHD).

ADE vs SSE is a burning topic at work for me right now as we are trying to define what our standards should be. SSE + CMK was launched in April 2020 which is said to be an improvement on ADE but Azure Security Center still flags you if you don't have ADE. Also, MS came out with two news types of Disk Encryption - Encryption at Host and Double Encryption. Encryption at Host is supposed to be better than ADE but is incompatible with ADE. There are not a lot of resources out there on this. I have scoured through whatever I could find. Would love to hear thoughts on ADE and SSE. Do you think SSE + CMK is better than ADE ?

I\u2019ve been fortunate to have worked with clients who passed on application forms they\u2019ve received when obtaining cyber & data breach insurance and found that every iteration dives deeper into how well their data is protected. This has lead to many conversations around explaining to technical and non-technical audiences about how Azure protects their data. I have to admit that I\u2019m not an encryption expert but have made a conscious effort to keep up with the technologies available to be a better solutions architect so this post serves to provide an overview of the various options of how data can be encrypted in Azure. Two of the types of encryption you\u2019ll see most while searching through Azure documentation will be: Server-side Encryption (SSE) Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) For the purpose of narrowing the scope, I will discuss how these apply to IaaS virtual machines in Azure and leave Storage Accounts in another post for the future. Due to the amount of content required for SSE and ADE, this post will be separated into two parts. Server-side Encryption (SSE) \u2013 Part #1 Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) \u2013 Part #2 Let me begin by providing the following links to the documentation provided by Microsoft: Server-side encryption of Azure Disk Storage https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disk-encryption Azure Data Encryption at rest https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-atrest Use the Azure portal to enable server-side encryption with customer-managed keys for managed disks https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-enable-customer-managed-keys-portal What is encryption at rest? https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-atrest#what-is-encryption-at-rest Azure Storage encryption for data at rest https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption Preview: Server-side encryption with customer-managed keys for Azure Managed Disks https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/blog/preview-server-side-encryption-with-customer-managed-keys-for-azure-managed-disks/ Data encryption models https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-models I\u2019ve found all of the documentation very information and highly suggest the read but it is also a bit difficult to tie all of the information together and impractical to send these to a client so the following is usually how I present the information either through a PowerPoint or discussion with Visio diagrams.

For more information, see the blog post Announcing server-side encryption with customer-managed keys for Azure Managed Disks. Today we\u2019re introducing the preview for server-side encryption (SSE) with customer-managed keys (CMK) for Azure Managed Disks. Azure customers already benefit from server-side encryption with platform managed keys (PMK) for Azure Managed Disks enabled by default. Customers also benefit from Azure disk encryption (ADE) that leverages the BitLocker feature of Windows and the DM-Crypt feature of Linux to encrypt Managed Disks with customer managed keys within the guest virtual machine. Server-side encryption with customer-managed keys improves on platform managed keys by giving you control of the encryption keys to meet your compliance needs. It improves on Azure disk encryption by enabling you to use any OS types and images for your virtual machines by encrypting data in the storage service. Server-side encryption with customer-managed keys is integrated with Azure Key Vault (AKV) that provides highly available and scalable, secure storage for RSA cryptographic keys backed by hardware security modules (HSMs). You can either import your RSA keys to Azure Key Vault or generate new RSA keys in Azure Key Vault. Azure Storage handles the encryption and decryption in a fully transparent fashion using envelope encryption. It encrypts data using an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256 based data encryption key which is in turn protected using your keys stored in Azure Key Vault. You have full control of your keys, and Azure Managed Disks uses system-assigned managed identity in your Azure Active Directory for accessing keys in Azure Key Vault. A user with required permissions in Azure Key Vault must first grant permissions before Azure Managed Disks can access the keys. You can prevent Azure Managed Disks from accessing your keys by either disabling your keys or by revoking access controls for your keys. Moreover, you can track the key usage through Azure Key Vault monitoring to ensure that only Azure Managed Disks or other trusted Azure services are accessing your keys. To enable customer-managed keys for Azure Managed Disks, you must first create an instance of a new\n[4]: URL: https://joestechspace.com/blog/encrypting-azure-vms-using-azure-disk-encryption-and-azure-key-vault --- Title: Encrypting Azure VMs using Azure Disk Encryption and Azure ... --- Body: Encrypting Azure VMs using Azure Disk Encryption and Azure Key Vault \u2014 Joe's Tech Space Blog About Contact Encrypting Azure VMs using Azure Disk Encryption and Azure Key Vault Azure Azure Key Vault Azure VMs 5 Dec A while ago, when I was studying for the AZ-500 exam I spent a fair chunk of time understanding Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) and Server Side Encryption (SSE) so I figured I\u2019d come back and write up explaining it and demonstrating it for those who might be in the same boat I was in! First, let\u2019s get into the details about key management Platform Managed Keys and Customer Managed Keys There\u2019s two types of encryption keys; platform-managed keys (PMK) and customer-managed keys (CMK). With PMK\u2019s, Azure manages the encryption keys. All data (disks, snapshots, images) is automatically encrypted at rest with PMKs. With CMKs, the customer (you) manages the encryption keys. You store these keys in an Azure Key Vault. You can import your own RSA keys into Key Vault or create new RSA keys in Key Vault. Key differences between Azure Disk Encryption and Server Side Encryption To put it simply, Server Side Encryption encrypts your disks at the storage account level, at rest. When you write data to the disk it is transmitted back to the underlying storage account unencrypted and is then encrypted at the storage account level. Azure Disk Encryption encrypts your disks at the Azure hypervisor level using in-guest OS encryption such as BitLocker for Windows VMs and DM-Crypt for Linux VMs. The data is transmitted back to the underlying storage account encrypted. Essentially, ADE encrypts your data end-to-end whereas SSE only encrypts it at end. Server Side Encryption is always enabled. You cannot turn it off as it\u2019s a platform-level feature. What one should I use? I\u2019m afraid the answer, as with a lot of Microsoft things is: \u201cIt depends.\u201d It depends on your organisations security and compliance requirements. If your organisation must ensure that all organisation data is encrypted at rest then SSE is suitable. If however, you must ensure that data is encrypted end-to-end, that it\u2019s encrypted using your own encryption keys or that you can regularly rotate (change) the encryption keys then ADE will be what you need. How do I setup SSE? By doing absolutely nothing. Just create a VM and it\u2019ll be done automatically by the Azure platform.

As you may already have seen, the Azure Security Center will recommend you to Encrypt your Azure Storage Accounts and/or Disks. So, what are your options? Encrypt your entire Storage account (SSE, Storage Service Encryption) Easy to setup! Just enable \u2018SSE\u2019 and you are done! Keys etc. are all managed by Microsoft! Exsisting Data is not Encrypted Only new data is Encrypted (new writes) Only ARM Storage Accounts!

Encrypt your Azure Disks (VHD\u2019s) with Azure Disk Encryption Can be hard to setup/configure. make appropriate choices based on your (compliance) needs This will enable Bitlocker inside your VM\u2019s Both ARM and ASM are supported You can manage which VM to encrypt or not Needs a Key Vault, this service helps you to encrypt and keeps keys and secrets, including storage account keys, data encryption keys, files, etc. Azure Storage Service Encryption (SSE) steps: Before creating VM\u2019s, create an Storage Account first with Encryption Enabled! Remember that only new data (new writes) are encrypted when SSE is enabled. When you create a new Storage Account you have the option to enable Storage Service Encryption (SSE) directly. Just Create a Storage Account as you should normally do and edit the settings: After creating the Storage Account, create a new VM and select this Storage Account. Notes about SSE: Encryption of classic storage accounts is not supported. Existing Data \u2013 SSE only encrypts newly created data after the encryption is enabled. If for example you create a new Resource Manager storage account but don\u2019t turn on encryption, and then you upload blobs or archived VHDs to that storage account and then turn on SSE, those blobs will not be encrypted unless they are rewritten or copied. Marketplace Support \u2013 Enable encryption of VMs created from the Marketplace using the Azure portal, PowerShell, and Azure CLI. The VHD base image will remain unencrypted; however, any writes done after the VM has spun up will be encrypted. Table and Queues data will not be encrypted.

In this article, you learn how to: Prepare Azure VMs. Create a vault. Discover VMs and configure a backup policy. Enable backup for Azure VMs. Run the initial backup. Note This article describes how to set up a vault and select VMs to back up. It's useful if you want to back up multiple VMs. Alternatively, you can back up a single Azure VM directly from the VM settings. Before you start Review the Azure VM backup architecture. Learn about Azure VM backup, and the backup extension. Review the support matrix before you configure backup. In addition, there are a couple of things that you might need to do in some circumstances: Install the VM agent on the VM: Azure Backup backs up Azure VMs by installing an extension to the Azure VM agent running on the machine. If your VM was created from an Azure Marketplace image, the agent is installed and running. If you create a custom VM, or you migrate an on-premises machine, you might need to install the agent manually. Note The functionality described in the following sections can also be accessed via Backup center. Backup center is a single unified management experience in Azure. It enables enterprises to govern, monitor, operate, and analyze backups at scale. With this solution, you can perform most of the key backup management operations without being limited to the scope of an individual vault. Create a Recovery Services vault A Recovery Services vault is a management entity that stores recovery points created over time and provides an interface to perform backup-related operations. These operations include taking on-demand backups, performing restores, and creating backup policies. To create a Recovery Services vault: Sign in to your subscription in the Azure portal. Search for Backup center in the Azure portal, and go to the Backup Center dashboard. Select +Vault from the Overview tab. Select Recovery Services vault > Continue.

When Should a New Azure AD Tenant Be Created? This document is intended for IT professionals who are leveraging Microsoft cloud-based technologies. It addresses the question: when should a new Azure AD tenant be created? Orientation and Terminology Azure AD provides a variety of capabilities that include authentication & credential management, collaboration & application management, device management, information security, and enable cloud-based solutions. If you are familiar with Active Directory, Azure AD is the cloud-based, infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) version, providing many of the same kinds of capabilities, but with all the benefits of a cloud-based solution. If you make use of Azure, you will be familiar with the term subscription. It\u2019s the Azure customer \u201caccount\u201d which ties together the various Azure services you are using. Here at the UW, you should get one via the Azure Subscription service as it provides contractual protections, a significant discount, and manages the Microsoft billing to UW budget process for you. The primary purpose of a subscription is to provide a common billing paradigm for use of Azure services. A subscription might have one or more tenants, directories, and domains associated with it. A tenant is the organization that owns and manages a specific instance of Microsoft cloud services. It\u2019s most often used in a inexact manner to refer to the set of Azure AD and Office 365 services for an organization, e.g. \u201cwe\u2019ve configured our tenant in this way.\u201d A given organization might have many tenants (the UW does), and when this is the case, the name of core domain of the tenant is usually used to remove any ambiguity. The name of the core domain comes in the form *.onmicrosoft.com, where the * varies. A tenant may have many subscriptions, exactly one directory, and one or more domains associated with it. There are multiple vendors which use the term \u201ctenant\u201d in slightly different ways, and there are even several Microsoft products using the term tenant. For the purposes of this guidance, we only mean an Azure AD or Office 365 tenant. To be explicit: Microsoft Windows Virtual Desktop tenants and Azure AD B2C tenants are not covered or restricted by this guidance. A directory is the Azure AD service. Each directory\n[3]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/concept-customer-managed-keys --- Title: Use customer-managed keys to encrypt your configuration ... --- Body: Use customer-managed keys to encrypt your configuration data | Microsoft Docs Azure Azure App Configuration Use customer-managed keys to encrypt your App Configuration data Article 12/09/2020 5 minutes to read 7 contributors In this article Overview Requirements Enable customer-managed key encryption for your Azure App Configuration instance Next Steps Azure App Configuration encrypts sensitive information at rest. The use of customer-managed keys provides enhanced data protection by allowing you to manage your encryption keys. When managed key encryption is used, all sensitive information in App Configuration is encrypted with a user-provided Azure Key Vault key. This provides the ability to rotate the encryption key on demand. It also provides the ability to revoke Azure App Configuration's access to sensitive information by revoking the App Configuration instance's access to the key. Overview Azure App Configuration encrypts sensitive information at rest using a 256-bit AES encryption key provided by Microsoft. Every App Configuration instance has its own encryption key managed by the service and used to encrypt sensitive information. Sensitive information includes the values found in key-value pairs. When customer-managed key capability is enabled, App Configuration uses a managed identity assigned to the App Configuration instance to authenticate with Azure Active Directory. The managed identity then calls Azure Key Vault and wraps the App Configuration instance's encryption key. The wrapped encryption key is then stored and the unwrapped encryption key is cached within App Configuration for one hour. App Configuration refreshes the unwrapped version of the App Configuration instance's encryption key hourly. This ensures availability under normal operating conditions. Important If the identity assigned to the App Configuration instance is no longer authorized to unwrap the instance's encryption key, or if the managed key is permanently deleted, then it will no longer be possible to decrypt sensitive information stored in the App Configuration instance. Using Azure Key Vault's soft delete function mitigates the chance of accidentally deleting your encryption key. When users enable the customer managed key capability on their Azure App Configuration instance, they control the service\u2019s ability to access their sensitive information. The managed key serves as a root encryption key. A user can revoke their App Configuration instance\u2019s access to their managed key by changing their key vault access policy. When this access is revoked, App Configuration will lose the ability to decrypt user data within one hour. At this point, the App Configuration instance will forbid all access\n[4]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/whats-new --- Title: What's new in Azure NetApp Files | Microsoft Docs --- Body: What's new in Azure NetApp Files | Microsoft Docs Azure Azure NetApp Files What's new in Azure NetApp Files Article 04/18/2022 19 minutes to read 3 contributors In this article April 2022 March 2022 January 2022 December 2021 November 2021 October 2021 September 2021 August 2021 June 2021 May 2021 April 2021 March 2021 December 2020 November 2020 September 2020 July 2020 May 2020 Next steps Azure NetApp Files is updated regularly.

The Recovery Services vault resource is available from the Settings menu of most Azure services. The benefit of having the Recovery Services vault integrated into the Settings menu of most Azure services is the ease of backing up data. However, working individually with each database or virtual machine in your business is tedious. What if you want to back up the data for all virtual machines in one department, or in one location? It's easy to back up multiple virtual machines by creating a backup policy and applying that policy to the desired virtual machines.

Today let\u2019s tackle a third configuration item: PhoneFactor\u2019s Trusted IPs. The Trusted IPs feature of Azure Multi-Factor Authentication bypasses multi-factor authentication prompts for people who sign in from a defined IP address range. You can set trusted IP ranges for your on-premises environments so when people are in one of those locations, there's no Azure Multi-Factor Authentication prompt. However, I feel there\u2019s a better way to handle this, with Named Locations. Why you\u2019d want to move to Named Locations There are a couple of reasons why you\u2019d want to make the move to Named Locations from Trusted IPs: IPv6 is supported for Named Locations Where the Trusted IPs functionality only supports IPv4 addresses, Named Locations can include both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Named Locations offer descriptions The Trusted IPs list, is just that; a list of IP addresses. The Named Locations name implies that it applies names to locations, defined as IP addresses. In Named Locations, you have the ability to provide a name for the IP addresses. This makes it more convenient for admins to manage locations, as they don\u2019t need to remember the IP ranges. Conditional Access offers more fine-grained controls Trusted IPs are IP addresses that are trusted for every application and for every user; They exclude the IP address from ever having to perform Multi-factor Authentication. In Conditional Access, you can set Named Locations as part of a Conditional Access policy and apply it to only selected apps, selected users, selected user risks or selected devices. Also, you can specify certain Named Locations for a Conditional Access policy, but not all of them (as you would with trusted IPs). Trusted IPs are also surfaced in Conditional Access, but do you really want to managed IP addresses in two places as an Azure AD admin?! Conditional Access applies to non-Azure MFA too The Trusted IPs functionality is part of the Azure Multi-Factor Authentication settings. As such, it does not apply to third-party multi-factor\n[2]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-mfasettings --- Title: Configure Azure AD Multi-Factor ... - docs.microsoft.com --- Body: Configure Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication - Azure Active Directory | Microsoft Docs Azure Active Directory Authentication Configure Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication settings Article 03/22/2022 20 minutes to read 28 contributors In this article Account lockout Block and unblock users Fraud alert Notifications OATH tokens Phone call settings MFA service settings Next steps To customize the end-user experience for Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication, you can configure options for settings like account lockout thresholds or fraud alerts and notifications. Some settings are available directly in the Azure portal for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), and some are in a separate Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication portal. The following Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication settings are available in the Azure portal: Feature Description Account lockout Temporarily lock accounts from using Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication if there are too many denied authentication attempts in a row. This feature applies only to users who enter a PIN to authenticate. (MFA Server only) Block/unblock users Block specific users from being able to receive Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication requests. Any authentication attempts for blocked users are automatically denied. Users remain blocked for 90 days from the time that they're blocked or until they're manually unblocked. Fraud alert Configure settings that allow users to report fraudulent verification requests. Notifications Enable notifications of events from MFA Server. OATH tokens Used in cloud-based Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication environments to manage OATH tokens for users. Phone call settings Configure settings related to phone calls and greetings for cloud and on-premises environments. Providers This will show any existing authentication providers that you have associated with your account. Adding new providers is disabled as of September 1, 2018. Account lockout To prevent repeated MFA attempts as part of an attack, the account lockout settings let you specify how many failed attempts to allow before the account becomes locked out for a period of time. The account lockout settings are applied only when a PIN code is entered for the MFA prompt. The following settings are available: Number of MFA denials that trigger account lockout Minutes until account lockout counter is reset Minutes until account is automatically unblocked To configure account lockout settings, complete these steps: Sign in to the Azure portal as an administrator. Go to Azure Active Directory > Security > MFA > Account lockout. Enter the values for your environment, and then select Save.

I am attempting to configure a conditional access policy that will do two things: Bypass the MFA requirement when a user logs in from one of our company's locations Require MFA for all other logins We have 47 locations all with dual WAN links so we are well past the 50 limit on MFA Trusted IPs and there is not a way to slim this number down below the threshold. I tried creating a CA rule that includes \"all locations\" but excludes \"trusted locations\". it is configured with a \"Grant access\" authorization with \"Require MFA\" selected. I have included my own user account in the test and no others. When I attempt a login from a trusted location, I am still getting the MFA prompt at sign-in.

We're wanting to remove the MFA prompt for users logging in while in the office. At the most basic requirement - be in the office - I can add the external IPs to MFA Trusted IPs (MFA Settings > Service Settings > Skip multi-factor authentication for requests from following range of IP address subnets). Why then (according to MS documentation), do I need to make a Conditional Access Policy that says if you're logging in from any location, EXCEPT TRUSTED, require MFA. If you log in from a trusted location, you're exempt from the policy which means it won't prompt for MFA, however the only IPs listed in MFA Trusted IPs are the ones belonging to your office. Please someone tell me what I'm missing here! I've been going over the documentation for the last little while and nothing is sticking out. (It's also a bit annoying that CA Grant Access cannot let you pick \"don't require MFA\"). That needs to be configured in a completely different location (mentioned above).

But getting the Guids, through Azure PowerShell seems to be a challenge. Part of the reason that there are 2 versions of available cmdlets - AzureAD* and AzAD. All the examples I have encountered on the internet are from AzureAD cmdlets . To talk right away about the problem, here is a working demo sample: $svc =New-AzADApplication-DisplayName \"ServicePrincipalNameSampleTestDL\" ` -IdentifierUris \"http://dummy.test.com\" # Associate a Service Principal to the service Application $sp = New-AzADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId $svc.ApplicationId Write-Host $sp.ApplicationId Write-Host $sp.Secret | ConvertFrom-SecureString | Out-File \"C:\\Temp\\Password.txt\" $BSTR = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($sp.Secret) $InsecurePassword = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringAuto($BSTR) Write-Host $InsecurePassword | Out-File \"C:\\Temp\\Password.txt\" [Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::ZeroFreeBSTR($BSTR) $req = New-Object -TypeName \"Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.RequiredResourceAccess\" $acc1 = New-Object -TypeName \"Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.ResourceAccess\" -ArgumentList \"03e0da56-190b-40ad-a80c-ea378c433f7f\",\"Scope\" #Delegated Access to Azure Storage $req.ResourceAccess = $acc1 $req.ResourceAppId = \"e406a681-f3d4-42a8-90b6-c2b029497af1\" #Azure Storage API $obj=Get-AzADApplication | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -eq \"ServicePrincipalNameSampleTestDL\"} Set-AzureADApplication -ObjectId $obj.ObjectId -RequiredResourceAccess $req -IdentifierUris \"http://dummy.test.com\" Now, if you see the sample, there are some GUIDs , which are hardcoded. Those GUIDs are something I retrieved from the Manifest of similar Service Principals created from the Portal. The reason for hardcoding them is because I can't retrieve that from AzureAD cmdlets. E.g. This returns rows Get-AzADServicePrincipal|Where-Object{$_.DisplayName-eq \"Azure Storage\"} ServicePrincipalNames : {e406a681-f3d4-42a8-90b6-c2b029497af1, https://storage.azure.com} ApplicationId : e406a681-f3d4-42a8-90b6-c2b029497af1 ObjectType : ServicePrincipal DisplayName : Azure Storage Id : e9137b2e-0128-4bd3-9ea5-303153f40461 Type : However, this returns no rows Get-AzureADServicePrincipal|Where-Object{$_.DisplayName-eq \"Azure Storage\"} This is very confusing, as both seem to be doing the same thing. Even without the filter on Where-Object , the AzureAD command returns far fewer rows than the corresponding AzAD cmdlet. Does anyone know why is that and how to go about resolving that? Basically I am trying to setup a Delegated permission to Azure Storage to my Service Principal without Hardcoding and because of this problem , I can't. I have followed this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42164581/how-to-configure-a-new-azure-ad-application-through-powershell But because of this problem, I have no option but hardcoding the GUIDs.

I'm doing some (slightly outdated) training for AZ-103 now and the instructor uses AzureRM. However, when I use it and I run \"Get-AzureRMADUser\", I run into an error Get-AzureRmADUser : Insufficient privileges to complete the operation. I'm the Global Admin, so I'm not sure what privileges I'm missing. This persists in Powershell 5.1, 6 and 7. I've tried Az in Powershell 7 and I can't even connect. When I try to authenticate with Connect-AzAccount, it comes back with the same 'insufficient privileges' issue. Getting frustrated with this (because I had a task to perform) I used AzureAD in PowerShell 5.1 and everything worked well. Connection worked and Get-AzureADUser worked. My basic understanding is that Az replaces AzureRM which replaces AzureAD. Is that correct? Or do I need to be working with 2 of these modules together? Also, if anyone has any understanding as to the privileges issue, I would appreciate some guidance. I'll free up some time tomorrow to try to deal with it as I'm obviously doing something wrong...but I have no idea what. 6 comments 84% Upvoted Log in or sign up to leave a comment Log In Sign Up Sort by: best level 1 SMFX \u00b7 2 yr. ago The AzureAD module is explicitly for user and identity objects within Azure AD.

Before I answer this question, let\u2019s remember that Azure Active Directory is probably one of the first services Microsoft 365 started with. Without Azure, AD users and organisation identities cannot exist on Microsoft 365 or Azure. Azure AD has three PowerShell modules capable of managing it to some degree and a full degree on Windows and other platforms at its current state, configuration and history. Below are all the modules that are currently supported: Msonline \u2013 Original and first PowerShell module release that allowed AD management using PowerShell. AzureAD \u2013 2nd released and recommended module, run on Windows only (No PowerShell 7 support) Az PowerShell \u2013 Run on all platforms (PowerShell 7) however it is missing many options and doesn\u2019t allow full management of Azure AD. Capabilities At this stage, you are probably asking yourself, why do we have 3 modules for managing a single service? The answer lies in the table below, which shows what you can and can\u2019t do with each module. Module Platform Functionality msonline Windows Full AzureAD Windows Full Az All platforms Semi Azure AD PowerShell If you look at the table closely, you can understand that the AzureAD module tops them all. It is the only module that offers full management capabilities of Azure AD via PowerShell. The downside of the AzureAD module is that it is based on PowerShell 5.1 and runs on Windows OS only, which can be a pain if you have a macOS or a Linux machine. Unfortunately, Microsoft has not yet ported all the commands to the Az module or made AzureAD PowerShell 7 compatible to allow all platforms to run the module. My feeling is that in the future, the AzureAD module will be PowerShell 7 based. The Az module is also capable of managing Azure AD; however, the number of commands is less, which result in limited management capabilities. If you need to create, add and delete users, the Az module will do the job. However, anything beyond that will be challenging. Installation When it comes to installation, all modules are accessible via the PowerShell Gallery using the following commands.

The Azure AD PowerShell modules you mentioned have some differences in their functionality and capabilities.\n\nThe AzureAD module was the second module released and is recommended for managing Azure AD. It runs on Windows only and does not have PowerShell 7 support [[5]](https://ntweekly.com/2021/06/29/which-azure-ad-powershell-module-is-recommended). The AzureAD module provides full management capabilities for Azure AD via PowerShell [[5]](https://ntweekly.com/2021/06/29/which-azure-ad-powershell-module-is-recommended).\n\nThe Az module, on the other hand, is a cross-platform module that runs on all platforms, including PowerShell 7. However, it is missing some options and does not allow full management of Azure AD like the AzureAD module does [[5]](https://ntweekly.com/2021/06/29/which-azure-ad-powershell-module-is-recommended).\n\nThe AzureRM module is an older module that was used to manage Azure resources, but it has been replaced by the Az module [[3]](https://andyleonard.blog/2019/10/powershell-and-azure-azurerm-vs-az). The Az module is the new Azure PowerShell module that is recommended for managing Azure resources [[4]](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-powershell-cross-platform-az-module-replacing-azurerm).\n\nIn summary, if you're looking for full management capabilities of Azure AD via PowerShell and you're using Windows, the AzureAD module is recommended. If you prefer a cross-platform solution or need to manage other Azure resources in addition to Azure AD, the Az module is the way to go.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thank you for the clarification.

Weekly I get questions about Azure AD application registrations and Enterprise Applications. And since you found this post, you are probably looking for a few answers yourself. Over the years I have done a lot of work that requires playing around with authentication in Azure. Especially the case I had with the secure application model and Microsoft CSP gave me some good insight into this space. In general, I have limited knowledge of Oauth2, etc. And most of my work in this space has been related to integration with Azure Management APIs The purpose of this post is to demystify everything around managed identities (MSI), Azure application registrations, and Enterprise Apps. Although Microsoft has this well documented, the context can be somewhat vague. Especially for new developers and IT Pros integrating with the Azure Control plane. Azure Application registrations Microsoft has a very robust identity platform in Azure AD. And by creating an application registration you can use this platform to authorize and authenticate various and multiple clients (Mobile, web apps, etc). When creating an application registration you establish a trust relationship between the Microsofts identity platform and your custom application, meaning you trust Microsoft, but Microsoft does not trust your application in the same way. You can create single-tenant, multi-tenant, and Microsoft (liveid) based app registrations or a combination of them. But the application definition is only tied to its home directory. Single-tenant configuration Only principals in the \u201chome\u201d tenant can authenticate. Multi-tenant application registrations Allows users and applications in other Azure AD tenants to access your app. Personal Microsoft accounts Here you can allow Microsoft Live ID accounts to access. Enterprise applications \u2013 service principals App registrations are not very functional on their own. Where App registrations is you custom application definition. Enterprise application is the application identity within your directory (Azure AD). The service principal (enterprise app) can only be assigned access to the directory it exists, and act as an instance of the application. Relationship between app registrations and enterprise applications. Enterprise applications (the service principal) have a reference to its Application registration.

Although, sometimes adding more layers may complicate things, the idea is to make it easier, simpler, and less consumer interactive. For your scenario, you'll want to think about what you would like to do. Would you like to have more control and implement your own logic with an Azure SQL DB protected by AAD, or try utilizing Microsoft's Managed Identity to protect/access the Azure SQL DB resource. (Ideally the Managed Identity path should be less work) The tutorial for using Managed Identities to access an azure SQL db from an app service can be found here : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-connect-msi The docs for protecting an Azure SQL DB using Azure AD can be found here : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-aad-authentication Furthermore Managed Identities are explained in the official Microsoft documentation here : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview It's important to note that there are two kinds of Managed Identities. From the documentation: A system-assigned managed identity is enabled directly on an Azure service instance. When the identity is enabled, Azure creates an identity for the instance in the Azure AD tenant that's trusted by the subscription of the instance. After the identity is created, the credentials are provisioned onto the instance. The lifecycle of a system-assigned identity is directly tied to the Azure service\n[3]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/managed-applications/publish-managed-identity --- Title: Managed app with Managed Identity - Azure Managed ... --- Body: Managed app with Managed Identity - Azure Managed Applications | Microsoft Docs Azure Resource Manager Managed Applications Azure Managed Application with Managed Identity Article 04/15/2022 8 minutes to read 4 contributors In this article How to use Managed Identity Adding Managed Identity Granting access to Azure resources Linking existing Azure resources Accessing the Managed Identity token Next steps Note Managed Identity support for Managed Applications is currently in preview. Please use the 2018-09-01-preview api version to utilize Managed Identity. Learn how to configure a Managed Application to contain a Managed Identity. Managed Identity can be used to allow the customer to grant the Managed Application access to additional existing resources. The identity is managed by the Azure platform and does not require you to provision or rotate any secrets. For more about managed identities in Azure Active Directory (AAD), see Managed identities for Azure resources. Your application can be granted two types of identities: A system-assigned identity is tied to your application and is deleted if your app is deleted. An app can only have one system-assigned identity. A user-assigned identity is a standalone Azure resource that can be assigned to your app. An app can have multiple user-assigned identities. How to use Managed Identity Managed Identity enables many scenarios for Managed Applications. Some common scenarios that can be solved are: Deploying a Managed Application linked to existing Azure resources. An example is deploying an Azure virtual machine (VM) within the Managed Application that is attached to an existing network interface. Granting the Managed Application and publisher access to Azure resources outside the managed resource group. Providing an operational identity of Managed Applications for Activity Log and other services within Azure. Adding Managed Identity Creating a Managed Application with a Managed Identity requires an additional property to be set on the Azure resource. The following example shows a sample identity property: JSON Copy {\"identity\": { \"type\": \"SystemAssigned, UserAssigned\", \"userAssignedIdentities\": { \"/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/testRG/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userassignedidentites/myuserassignedidentity\": {} } } There are two common ways to create a Managed Application with identity: CreateUIDefinition.json and Azure Resource Manager templates. For simple single create scenarios, CreateUIDefinition should be used to enable Managed Identity, because it provides a richer experience. However, when dealing with advanced or complex systems that require automated or multiple Managed Application deployments, templates can be used. Using CreateUIDefinition A Managed Application can be configured with Managed Identity through the CreateUIDefinition.json.

Then you store that sensitive information in an Azure Key Vault and have your application fetch it from there using its managed identity. After that, you\u2019d use that fetched piece of information for authenticating to the API in your code. But did you know that there\u2019s also an alternative way, which allows us to skip creating the application registration, client secret/certificate, and Azure Key Vault entirely? We can allow our applications to authenticate to Azure AD protected APIs directly with the application managed identity. We don\u2019t need to have a client secret or a certificate, and we can get rid of the risk of those pieces of sensitive information getting leaked. Otherwise, it works seemingly the same way by allowing us to use APIs with application permissions; it is just more secure. Managed identity is not a new feature, and I know a few people have already blogged about this topic in the past. Still, I continue to run into developers who are not familiar with this approach. Based on my experience, it is clear that this method requires more exposure, which is why I am here writing about it for you. I hope you\u2019ll find this article useful, and love using managed identity for authenticating to Azure AD protected APIs just as much as I do. The Managed Service Identity (MSI) feature has been renamed to Managed identities for Azure resources. In this blog post, I\u2019ll mostly be referring to this feature simply as managed identity. What are Managed identities for Azure resources? A managed identity allows an Azure-hosted app to access other Azure AD protected services without having to specify explicit credentials for authentication. When you enable the managed identity for your app, a service principal gets created for your application in Azure AD. You can then grant that principal varying levels of permissions to the Azure resources and APIs used by your application. When we do not need to use and store separate credentials, it automatically improves the security of our application. \u201cWhen you enable\n[5]: URL: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/demystifying-service-principals-managed-identities --- Title: Demystifying Service Principals - Managed Identities | Azure DevOps Blog --- Body: Demystifying Service Principals - Managed Identities - Azure DevOps Blog Demystifying Service Principals \u2013 Managed Identities Peter D January 28th, 2021 Hey friends, In this article, I want to clarify one of the more confusing concepts in Azure and more specifically around the Azure Identity objects known as Service Principals and Managed Identities. Before zooming in on these, let\u2019s take a step back and look at the different Azure Identity Objects we have available in Azure Active Directory today. Azure AD Identity Azure AD is the trusted Identity Object store, in which you can create different Identity Object types. The most common ones are Users and Groups, but you can also have Applications in there, also known as Enterprise Apps. An example for each could be: Users: you create a user object in Azure AD, and from there allow the user to authenticate to the Azure Portal, to start using Office 365,\u2026 Groups: you define a security group in Azure AD, which can be used to specify permissions to SharePoint sites for example Enterprise Apps: using OpenIDConnect and OAuth, you allow a cloud-based application to trust your Azure AD for user authentication; the trusting app is known as an enterprise app object in Azure AD. Service Principal Most relevant to Service Principal, is the Enterprise apps; according to the formal definition, a service principal is \u201c\u2026An application whose tokens can be used to authenticate and grant access to specific Azure resources from a user-app, service or automation tool, when an organization is using Azure Active Directory\u2026\u201d In essence, by using a Service Principal, you avoid creating \u201cfake users\u201d (we would call them service account in on-premises Active Directory\u2026) in Azure AD to manage authentication when you need to access Azure Resources. The Service Principals\u2019 access can be restricted by assigning Azure RBAC roles so that they can access the specific set of resources only. There is one major exception to this RBAC rule, and that is Azure Key Vault, which can be extended by using Key Vault Access Policies to define permissions, instead of Azure RBAC roles. (to be 100% correct on this statement, there is actually a preview available since mid Oct 2020, allowing RBAC KeyVault access as well \u2013 check this article for more details). Typical use cases where you would rely on a Service Principal is for example when running Terraform IAC (Infrastructure as Code) deployments, or\n", "messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!

I'm fairly new to Azure DevOps and I've just started setting up some projects ready to migrate away from JIRA. However, something I cannot figure out is how to change the date formats in the DevOps web interface. We are in the UK and want UK format dates everywhere (dd/mm/yyyy). I have found that I can change this in my User Settings but it hasn't changed what I see in various screens. For example, dashboard widgets still show American dates. Burndown Trends still show American dates. This is really frustrating. How do I configure UK dates for all areas for all users? All of our projects will be the same, we will never ever use American dates. I've gone through project settings and organisation settings but can't find it anywhere, and Googling returned nothing useful. Thanks in advance.

The renewal option became available March 2021 for an extended list of certifications on Azure, Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365. Check out this link for an overview of eligible ones. So, what to expect from this assessment review? I\u2019ll try to answer your questions about the level, the preparation and the renewal process itself. Those were the questions I had, when starting. Update 12-4-2022 I renewed my Azure SA certification for another year. Nothing really changed except for the assessment modules. This year there are 7 instead of 8 modules. The assessment section is updated with the correct modules and links. Renewal In my case, I have a current Azure Solutions Architect Expert certification as of January 2019. Previously the certification was current for two years. In my case until the end of January 2021. Microsoft first extended the validity period with 6 months to the end of July 2021 and released the renewal option in the beginning of March. At March the 2nd 2021, I received the email below, that advises to pass the online assessment. When expired, you need to re-take the AZ-305 (Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions) exam to stay certified. Microsoft retired AZ-303 and AZ-304 at March 31, 2022, so these cannot be taken anymore Passing the Azure 70-535 (Architecting Microsoft Azure Solutions) and AZ-302 (transition) exams 3 years ago (while being a Azure novice at the time) was a tough nut to crack, so I really want to prevent that. Assessment details The renewal process requires you to pass the free, online only, non-proctored assessment. When you login to the renewal site with a email address that has your MCP ID assigned, it should be available to you. The assessment itself consists of 26 multiple choice questions and has to be finished in 45 minutes. It even can be performed multiple times. After the second attempt you\u2019ll have to wait 24 hours before a retake is possible. In contrary to some proctored exams, there is no time extension for non-native English speaking persons.

In today\u2019s digital world, the cloud has changed everything about how we work, including how applications are designed, implemented, and secured. This change is definitely for the better, but it brings new challenges to organizations. Deployments must be automated and predictable, architecture has to handle spikes in traffic, applications have to be resilient when failures occur, data must be secure and not vulnerable to malicious actors\u2014and these are just some of the challenges. The Azure solutions architect is key to all of this and more, and the updated certification better aligns to the skills of real-world solutions architects and the tasks they perform. What you need to know about the coming update A successful Azure solutions architect has multifaceted skills and experience, including the ability to both implement and design for the cloud\u2014from start to finish. The updated certification delineates and supports both of these capabilities and validates what\u2019s required for each. Additionally, given the expert level of the certification and the critical demands of the role, it\u2019s important to have the foundation of an associate certification, as is required for our other expert certifications. We\u2019ll release the beta version of the new Exam AZ-305: Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions on November 16, 2021. It will be required to earn the Azure Solutions Architect Expert certification. The new exam is focused on the skills required to design cloud and hybrid solutions that run on Azure, including compute, network, storage, monitoring, and security. The exam also includes key skills related to design best practices and patterns, like the ones included in the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure and the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework. For a deeper look at the skills measured by the new exam, explore the Exam AZ-305 skills outline. Candidates for this certification will also be required to earn the Azure Administrator Associate certification, which proves subject matter expertise in implementing, managing, and monitoring Azure solutions.

To change the Bill-To contact, a request needs to be made through a partner/software advisor to the Regional Operations Center (ROC). The first enrollment administrator that is set up during the enrollment provisioning determines the authentication type of the Bill-to contact account. When the bill-to contact gets added to the EA Portal as a read-only administrator, they are given Microsoft account authentication. For example, if the initial authentication type is set to Mixed, the EA will be added as a Microsoft account and the Bill-to contact will have read-only EA admin privileges. If the EA admin doesn\u2019t approve Microsoft account authorization for an existing Bill-to contact, the EA admin may delete the user in question and ask the customer to add the user back as a read-only administrator with a Work or School account Only set at enrollment level in the EA portal.

Only on-prem 5 level 1 icebrian \u00b7 3 yr. ago \u00b7 edited 3 yr. ago Enterprise Admin is a role only available in Enterprise Agreement contracts. This is the main contact within your company who is responsible for the entire Azure contract. Besides Enterprise Admin you have, Department Admins, Account Admin and Service Admins. These roles are typically for the EA portal (http://ea.azure.com) where you can access billing, user accounts and subscriptions. A subscription owner is not necessarily the Enterprise Admin, althought that is probably a good place to start. Go to \"subscriptions\" and Access Control (IAM) for the subscription. There you can see who is owner of the subscription and that person will probably know who is the Enterprise Admin, if not you will probably need to ask arround. Hope this help.

Cyber-attackers use credential theft attacks to target administrator accounts and other privileged access to try to gain access to sensitive data. For cloud services, prevention and response are the joint responsibilities of the cloud service provider and the customer. For more information about the latest threats to endpoints and the cloud, see the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report. This article can help you develop a roadmap toward closing the gaps between your current plans and the guidance described here. Note Microsoft is committed to the highest levels of trust, transparency, standards conformance, and regulatory compliance. Learn more about how the Microsoft global incident response team mitigates the effects of attacks against cloud services, and how security is built into Microsoft business products and cloud services at Microsoft Trust Center - Security and Microsoft compliance targets at Microsoft Trust Center - Compliance. Traditionally, organizational security was focused on the entry and exit points of a network as the security perimeter. However, SaaS apps and personal devices on the Internet have made this approach less effective. In Azure AD, we replace the network security perimeter with authentication in your organization's identity layer, with users assigned to privileged administrative roles in control. Their access must be protected, whether the environment is on-premises, cloud, or a hybrid. Securing privileged access requires changes to: Processes, administrative practices, and knowledge management Technical components such as host defenses, account protections, and identity management Secure your privileged access in a way that is managed and reported in the Microsoft services you care about. If you have on-premises administrator accounts, see the guidance for on-premises and hybrid privileged access in Active Directory at Securing Privileged Access.

The enterprise administrator role is focused on managing the Azure EA services and does not have direct control over Azure AD user roles or permissions.\n\n2. Azure EA Portal: Much of the administrative management associated with the enterprise administrator role is performed through the Azure EA Portal. This online management portal allows enterprise administrators to create and manage departments, accounts, and subscriptions, as well as access billing information, usage reports, and price lists [[[1]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/understand-ea-roles)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/understand-ea-roles) [[[2]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/ea-portal-administration)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/ea-portal-administration).\n\n3.

Collaboration with Other Roles: The enterprise administrator role often works in collaboration with other administrative roles within the Azure EA, such as department administrators and account owners. These roles have specific responsibilities and permissions within their respective areas, and the enterprise administrator oversees and coordinates their activities [[[1]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/understand-ea-roles)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/understand-ea-roles) [[[2]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/ea-portal-administration)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/ea-portal-administration).\n\nOverall, the enterprise administrator plays a crucial role in managing the Azure EA services, overseeing access and spending, and ensuring the efficient use of Azure resources within the organization."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks.

These are the best online courses to pass this exam in the first attempt Hello Guys, If you are preparing for AZ-900 or Microsoft Azure Fundamentals exam and looking for some good online courses to pass this exam, then you have come to the right place. In the past, I have shared the best courses to learn Azure and certifications like Azure Administrator (AZ-104), Azure Developer (AZ-204), and Azure Architect (AZ-303) In this article, I am going to list down some of the best courses to crack the AZ-900 certification exam. You may know that Cloud computing is becoming more and more critical, and it\u2019s almost mandatory for both technical and non-tech IT people to know about Cloud computing and different Cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP. You just can\u2019t hide with Cloud anymore, you need to learn it to understand and master it to stay relevant in technology jobs. Thankfully there is a lot of learning material available to learn about the benefits of the Cloud and why companies should move to the Cloud. Still, certifications are probably the best way to develop knowledge, skill, and get the recognition required by many Cloud jobs. If you are just getting started with Cloud Computing and Cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure, then Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) is probably the best certification to build foundational Cloud skills and also get the recognition. This certification is very similar to the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification and primarily designed for candidates looking to demonstrate foundational level knowledge of cloud services and how those services are provided with Microsoft Azure platforms. People, who successfully pass this exam, known as Microsoft Azure Fundamentals or AZ-900, will earn the Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals? Certification, which is recognized in many cloud-based jobs. You can also put the certification badge on your LinkedIn profile and your resume to attract recruiters. This exam can be also be taken as an optional first step in learning about cloud services and how those concepts are exemplified by Microsoft Azure.

Common use cases How logging works Log format Enabling NSG Flow Logs Updating parameters Working with Flow logs NSG flow logging considerations Best practices Troubleshooting common issues FAQ Pricing Introduction Network security group (NSG) flow logs is a feature of Azure Network Watcher that allows you to log information about IP traffic flowing through an NSG. Flow data is sent to Azure Storage accounts from where you can access it as well as export it to any visualization tool, SIEM, or IDS of your choice. Why use Flow Logs? It is vital to monitor, manage, and know your own network for uncompromised security, compliance, and performance. Knowing your own environment is of paramount importance to protect and optimize it. You often need to know the current state of the network, who is connecting, where they're connecting from, which ports are open to the internet, expected network behavior, irregular network behavior, and sudden rises in traffic. Flow logs are the source of truth for all network activity in your cloud environment. Whether you're an upcoming startup trying to optimize resources or large enterprise trying to detect intrusion, Flow logs are your best bet. You can use it for optimizing network flows, monitoring throughput, verifying compliance, detecting intrusions and more. Common use cases Network Monitoring: Identify unknown or undesired traffic. Monitor traffic levels and bandwidth consumption. Filter flow logs by IP and port to understand application behavior. Export Flow Logs to analytics and visualization tools of your choice to set up monitoring dashboards. Usage monitoring and optimization: Identify top talkers in your network. Combine with GeoIP data to identify cross-region traffic. Understand traffic growth for capacity forecasting. Use data to remove overtly restrictive traffic rules. Compliance: Use flow data to verify network isolation and compliance with enterprise access rules Network forensics & Security analysis: Analyze network flows from compromised IPs and network interfaces. Export flow logs to any SIEM or IDS tool of your choice. How logging works Key Properties Flow logs operate at Layer 4 and record all IP flows going in and out of an NSG Logs are collected at 1-min interval through the Azure platform and do not\n[3]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-troubleshoot-connectivity-problem-between-vms --- Title: Troubleshooting connectivity problems between \ue000Azure\ue001 VMs | Microsoft Docs --- Body: Troubleshooting connectivity problems between Azure VMs | Microsoft Docs Azure Networking Virtual Network Troubleshooting connectivity problems between Azure VMs Article 01/02/2022 3 minutes to read 7 contributors In this article Symptom Troubleshooting guidance Troubleshooting steps You might experience connectivity problems between Azure virtual machines (VMs). This article provides troubleshooting steps to help you resolve this problem. If your Azure issue is not addressed in this article, visit the Azure forums on Microsoft Q & A and Stack Overflow. You can post your issue in these forums, or post to @AzureSupport on Twitter. You also can submit an Azure support request. To submit a support request, on the Azure support page, select Get support. Symptom One Azure VM cannot connect to another Azure VM. Troubleshooting guidance Check whether NIC is misconfigured Check whether network traffic is blocked by NSG or UDR Check whether network traffic is blocked by VM firewall Check whether VM app or service is listening on the port Check whether the problem is caused by SNAT Check whether traffic is blocked by ACLs for the classic VM Check whether the endpoint is created for the classic VM Try to connect to a VM network share Check Inter-Vnet connectivity Troubleshooting steps Follow these steps to troubleshoot the problem. After you complete each step, check whether the problem is resolved. Step 1: Check whether NIC is misconfigured Follow the steps in How to reset network interface for Azure Windows VM. If the problem occurs after you modify the network interface (NIC), follow these steps: Multi-NIC VMs Add a NIC. Fix the problems in the bad NIC or remove the bad NIC. Then add the NIC again. For more information, see Add network interfaces to or remove from virtual machines. Single-NIC VM Redeploy Windows VM Redeploy Linux VM Step 2: Check whether network traffic is blocked by NSG or UDR Use Network Watcher IP Flow Verify and NSG Flow Logging to determine whether there is a Network Security Group (NSG) or User-Defined Route (UDR) that is interfering with traffic flow. Step 3: Check whether network traffic is blocked by VM firewall Disable the firewall, and then test the result. If the problem is resolved, verify the firewall settings, and then re-enable the firewall. Step 4: Check whether VM app or service is listening on the port You can use one of the following methods to check whether the VM app or\n[4]: URL: https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-us/2c1b528b-dc68-4030-b29a-09ce685c570b/open-ports-25587-in-order-to-send-email-from-an-azure-vm --- Title: Open Ports 25/587 in order to send email from an Azure VM --- Body: Open Ports 25/587 in order to send email from an Azure VM Ask a question Quick access Asked by: Open Ports 25/587 in order to send email from an Azure VM Archived Forums > Azure Virtual Machines Question 0 Sign in to vote Hello, I need to send SMTP mails from a VM located in subscription 2xxxxxxxxxxxx Can you open TCP destination ports 25 & 587 ?

Microsoft recommends that you utilize authenticated SMTP relay services (typically connected via TCP port 587, but often others, as well) to send email from Azure Virtual Machines. SMTP relay services specialize in sender reputation, to minimize the possibility that third-party email providers reject messages. Such SMTP relay services include, but are not limited to, Exchange Online Protection and SendGrid. Use of SMTP relay services is in no way restricted in Azure, regardless of your subscription type. Enterprise Agreement: Outbound port 25 communication is allowed. You are able to send outbound email directly from virtual machines to external email providers, with no restrictions from the Azure platform. Pay-as-you-go: Outbound port 25 communication is blocked from all resources. If you need to send email from a virtual machine directly to external email providers (not using an authenticated SMTP relay), you can make a request to remove the restriction. Requests are reviewed and approved at Microsoft's discretion and are only granted after anti-fraud checks are performed. To make a request, open a support case with the issue type Technical, Virtual Network Connectivity, cannot send e-mail (SMTP/Port 25). MSDN, Azure Pass, Azure in Open, Education, BizSpark, and Free trial: Outbound port 25 communication is blocked from all resources. No requests to remove the restriction can be made, because requests are not granted. If you must send email from your virtual machine, you must use an SMTP relay service.

Or maybe even used the wrong name completely! Your initial reaction would probably be to rename the Azure Resource Group. But can you? Unfortunately, Azure does not support renaming an RG. This rename function request has been in limbo since 2014. If you\u2019ve only created the RG and have not added resources to it yet, the quickest workaround is to delete the RG and create a new one. But if the RG is not empty, you obviously cannot delete it right away to start over. What do you do then? Lucky for you, this article will teach you the next best thing\u2014to move resources to a new RG as a way to rename Azure Resource Groups. Let\u2019s get started! Prerequisites This article will be a tutorial. If you plan on following along step-by-step, you will need the following: An Azure Subscription \u2013 If you don\u2019t have one, you can register for a free Azure account. An Azure user account \u2013 The user account must have at least a Contributor Role permission to the Azure subscription. This role enables you to create and delete resource groups and move resources between resource groups. Two resource groups \u2013 Where you\u2019ll be moving resources from and to. In this tutorial, the two resource groups are: rg-my-old-resourcegroup \u2013 The source RG contains two resources; a Virtual Network named vn-eus-vnet-01 and a Storage Account named adamtheautomator. rg-my-new-resourcegroup \u2013 The empty destination RG, which is the target for moving the resources from rg-my-old-resourcegroup. This tutorial will only cover moving resources between resource groups in the same Azure subscription. Moving of resources between subscriptions is possible subject to the move operation support for resources in Azure. Moving Resources Using The Azure Portal If not automating a task, even IT pros would most likely favor the Azure Portal to manage Azure resources. Using the Azure Portal, you can visually review the available resources and move them into a new RG with a few mouse clicks. While moving resources, both the source and destination resource groups will be in a locked state that may last for\n[3]: URL: https://serverfault.com/questions/777873/azure-portal-rename-resources --- Title: \ue000Azure\ue001 portal \ue000rename\ue001 resources - Server Fault --- Body: Azure portal rename resources - Server Fault Azure portal rename resources Ask Question Asked 5 years, 11 months ago Modified 4 years, 1 month ago Viewed 17k times 11 Anyone have any idea on how i can rename azure resources?

Neither on resource name or on resource group name. The correct naming ruling put in place from the very beginning is one of the most important aspects. Try to define yourself as early as possible the criteria for that. If not, working with ARM templates may ease your pain by helping you redeploy \"bad\" resources faster and easier.

Now everybody would say: Are you serroius? Yes it is not that difficult! The Azure Cli / Powershell allows you to export the whole resourcegroup Definition (except for some resources!). --> Export the Definition, --> rename Names in the exportet template --> Deploy Template --> Voila! Every resource has it's old configuration except the name. It takes some time to get familiar to that process, but afterwars you are pretty fast rename, clone, do anything with complete ressources!

For managing Azure resources, see Manage Azure resources by using Azure PowerShell. Other articles about managing resource groups: Manage Azure resource groups by using the Azure portal Manage Azure resource groups by using Azure CLI What is a resource group A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group can include all the resources for the solution, or only those resources that you want to manage as a group. You decide how you want to add resources to resource groups based on what makes the most sense for your organization. Generally, add resources that share the same lifecycle to the same resource group so you can easily deploy, update, and delete them as a group. The resource group stores metadata about the resources. When you specify a location for the resource group, you're specifying where that metadata is stored. For compliance reasons, you may need to ensure that your data is stored in a particular region. Create resource groups To create a resource group, use New-AzResourceGroup. Azure PowerShell Copy Try It New-AzResourceGroup -Name exampleGroup -Location westus List resource groups To list the resource groups in your subscription, use Get-AzResourceGroup. Azure PowerShell Copy Try It Get-AzResourceGroup To get one resource group, provide the name of the resource group.

Azure PowerShell Copy Try It Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name exampleGroup For more information about how Azure Resource Manager orders the deletion of resources, see Azure Resource Manager resource group deletion. Deploy resources You can deploy Azure resources by using Azure PowerShell, or by deploying an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template or Bicep file. The following example creates a storage account.

You can use the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or the REST API to move resources. Both the source group and the target group are locked during the move operation. Write and delete operations are blocked on the resource groups until the move completes. This lock means you can't add, update, or delete resources in the resource groups. It doesn't mean the resources are frozen. For example, if you move an Azure SQL logical server, its databases and other dependent resources to a new resource group or subscription, applications that use the databases experience no downtime. They can still read and write to the databases. The lock can last for a maximum of four hours, but most moves complete in much less time. If your move requires setting up new dependent resources, you'll experience an interruption in those services until they've been reconfigured. Moving a resource only moves it to a new resource group or subscription. It doesn't change the location of the resource. Changed resource ID When you move a resource, you change its resource ID. The standard format for a resource ID is /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/{resourceProviderNamespace}/{resourceType}/{resourceName}. When you move a resource to a new resource group or subscription, you change one or more values in that path. If you use the resource ID anywhere, you'll need to change that value. For example, if you have a custom dashboard in the portal that references a resource ID, you'll need to update that value. Look for any scripts or templates that need to be updated for the new resource ID. Checklist before moving resources There are some important steps to do before moving a resource. By verifying these conditions, you can avoid errors. The resources you want to move must support the move operation.

I apologize because this s is going to be a long post with all the steps to achieve the notification goals, so please bear with me if you\u2019re interested in getting the configuration done. Lots of customers are using Teams channel as notification mechanism in their alert management process. They find it very helpful because Teams can be used over mobile devices and browsers without relying on your company laptop. Apparently, there\u2019s no built-in activity in Azure Monitor out of the box to notify an alert via Teams, but we DO have all the pieces that we need. In this post I will drive you through the Azure Monitor configuration which is behind the Teams channel alert notification mechanism. First and foremost, a Teams and a Teams channel need to exist.

They provide a conversational user interface that works very well in Microsoft Teams and other chat-based applications. So-called \u201cQnA Maker\u201d bots have been around for awhile; they require little to no code, but they\u2019re limited to matching user questions with a list of pre-defined answers in the QnA Maker service. Until recently, building a bot that can do more, such as taking actions on behalf of a user in Microsoft Teams, meant doing a lot of coding, as well as training and integrating cognitive services for language recognition and knowledge management. All of that has changed, opening a new set of options for building sophisticated Microsoft Teams bots. One of the options, Power Virtual Agents, is part of the Power Platform suite and is tightly integrated with Power Automate. This article, however, will consider another, lesser known, but perhaps even more powerful option, Bot Framework Composer. Bot Framework Composer is designed for low-code and full-code developers alike. It provides an easy-to-use design surface for building a bot, integration with Azure cognitive services, and it works well for teams of developers building apps that can be deployed in multiple Microsoft 365 tenants. This makes it a great choice for ISVs and system integrators who want to deploy a centrally hosted bot for many customers, as well as for enterprise developers. The Microsoft 365 Developer Advocacy team is pleased to announce a new video series that is all about Bot Framework Composer. It starts at the beginning, creating a bot from scratch, and leads the viewer through building more advanced features such as language recognition, Adaptive Card responses, user authentication, and calling the Microsoft Graph API which allows access to data throughout the Microsoft 365 suite. Developer advocates Ayca Bas and Bob German will be your guides on this journey from zero to Bot hero. Here is a listing of the videos, along with the reference materials used in each.

Ask Question 4 I have a Bot created with v4 of the Microsoft Bot Framework. I can successfully use this bot in the \"Test in Web Chat\" portion in the Azure Portal. I can also successfully use this bot in an app that I've created in Microsoft Teams. I now want to send a notification from the \"Test in Web Chat\" piece to a specific user in Teams. For example, in the \"Test in Web Chat\" piece, I'd like to enter Hello someuser@mytenant.com When this is sent via the \"Test in Web Chat\" piece, I'd like to show \"Hello\" in Microsoft Teams to only someuser@mytenant.com. I have successfully tokenized the string from the \"Test in Web Chat\". Thus, I know what I want to send, and who I want to send it to. However, I do not know how to actually send it. Currently, I have the following in my bot: public class EchoBot : ActivityHandler { private ConcurrentDictionary<string, ConversationReference> _conversationReferences; public EchoBot(ConcurrentDictionary<string, ConversationReference> conversationReferences) { _conversationReferences = conversationReferencs; } private void AddConversationReference(Activity activity) { var reference = activity.GetConversationReference(); _conversationReferences.AddOrUpdate(reference.User.Id, reference, (key, newValue) => reference); } protected override async Task OnMessageActivityAsync(ITurnContext<IMessageActivity> context, CancellationToken cancellationToken) { AddConversationReference(context.Activity as Activity); var parameters = GetParameters(); // Parses context.Activity.Text; // Send a message to the target (i.e. someuser@mytenant.com) var connection = new Microsoft.Bot.Connector.ConnectorClient(new Uri(context.Activity.ServiceUrl)); var tenant = context.Activity.GetChannelData<TeamsChannelData>().Tenant; // how do I send the message to parameters.Target? // Confirm message was sent to the sender var confirmation = $\"Message was sent to {parameters.Target}.\"; await context.SendActivityAsync(MessageFactory.Text(confirmation)); } } I've reviewed how to send proactive notifications to users.

By creating a policy, you avoid the scenario of resources being deployed to your subscription that don't have the expected tags for your organization. Instead of manually applying tags or searching for resources that aren't compliant, you create a policy that automatically applies the needed tags during deployment. Tags can also now be applied to existing resources with the new Modify effect and a remediation task. The following section shows example policy definitions for tags.

In Cloud, Tags are metadata values that contain keys and values to help users organize and bring governance to cloud resources. Tagging is essential because it helps to efficiently optimize costs across cloud providers by assigning useful information to any resource within your cloud infrastructure. It also helps to group the resources based on application or business. In Azure, each resource, resource group, and subscription can have a maximum of 50 tag name/value pairs. The tag name is limited to 512 characters, and the tag value is limited to 256 characters. For storage accounts, the tag name is limited to 128 characters, and the tag value is limited to 256 characters. Our Approach : For each resource deployment, we can pass the standard tags but at some point, it will become painful since we might need to pass the value for more than 10 tags for each resource deployment. How to overcome this pain area? Here are a few tricks that can be followed in your subscriptions. Create a resource group with mandatory tags Apply subscription level policy to inherit missing tags from the resource group \u2013 If you have only one or two tags. If you have multiple tags, use the policy initiative Option -1 : Definiation tag inheritance: If you need to manage one or two tags, use azure policy to update tags automatically by inheriting them from the resource group. Login to Azure portal with contributor access. 2. Navigate to Policy (Search policy in the top search bar) 3. Navigate to definition and in the search bar, just type \u201c inherit \u201c.

Why should I give risk feedback to Azure AD\u2019s risk assessments? How does Azure AD use my risk feedback? How should I give risk feedback and what happens under the hood? Next steps Azure AD Identity Protection allows you to give feedback on its risk assessment. The following document lists the scenarios where you would like to give feedback on Azure AD Identity Protection\u2019s risk assessment and how we incorporate it. What is a detection? An Identity Protection detection is an indicator of suspicious activity from an identity risk perspective. These suspicious activities are called risk detections. These identity-based detections can be based on heuristics, machine learning or can come from partner products. These detections are used to determine sign-in risk and user risk, User risk represents the probability an identity is compromised. Sign-in risk represents the probability a sign-in is compromised (for example, the sign-in is not authorized by the identity owner). Why should I give risk feedback to Azure AD\u2019s risk assessments? There are several reasons why you should give Azure AD risk feedback: You found Azure AD\u2019s user or sign-in risk assessment incorrect. For example, a sign-in shown in \u2018Risky sign-ins\u2019 report was benign and all the detections on that sign-in were false positives. You validated that Azure AD\u2019s user or sign-in risk assessment was correct. For example, a sign-in shown in \u2018Risky sign-ins\u2019 report was indeed malicious and you want Azure AD to know that all the detections on that sign-in were true positives. You remediated the risk on that user outside of Azure AD Identity Protection and you want the user\u2019s risk level to be updated. How does Azure AD use my risk feedback? Azure AD uses your feedback to update the risk of the underlying user and/or sign-in and the accuracy of these events. This feedback helps secure the end user. For example, once you confirm a sign-in is compromised, Azure AD immediately increases the user\u2019s risk and sign-in\u2019s aggregate risk (not real-time risk) to High. If this user is included in your user risk policy to force High risk users to securely reset their passwords, the user will automatically remediate itself\n[2]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-remediate-unblock --- Title: Remediate risks and unblock users in Azure AD Identity ... --- Body: Remediate risks and unblock users in Azure AD Identity Protection | Microsoft Docs Azure Active Directory Identity protection Remediate risks and unblock users Article 02/17/2022 5 minutes to read 1 contributor In this article Remediation Unblocking users PowerShell preview Next steps After completing your investigation, you need to take action to remediate the risk or unblock users. Organizations can enable automated remediation using their risk policies. Organizations should try to close all risk detections that they're presented in a time period your organization is comfortable with. Microsoft recommends closing events quickly, because time matters when working with risk. Remediation All active risk detections contribute to the calculation of a value called user risk level. The user risk level is an indicator (low, medium, high) for the probability that an account has been compromised. As an administrator, you want to get all risk detections closed, so that the affected users are no longer at risk. Some risks detections may be marked by Identity Protection as \"Closed (system)\" because the events were no longer determined to be risky. Administrators have the following options to remediate: Self-remediation with risk policy Manual password reset Dismiss user risk Close individual risk detections manually Remediation framework If the account is confirmed compromised: Select the event or user in the Risky sign-ins or Risky users reports and choose \"Confirm compromised\". If a risk policy or a Conditional Access policy wasn't triggered at part of the risk detection, and the risk wasn't self-remediated, then: Request a password reset. Block the user if you suspect the attacker can reset the password or do multi-factor authentication for the user. Revoke refresh tokens. Disable any devices considered compromised. If using continuous access evaluation, revoke all access tokens. For more information about what happens when confirming compromise, see the section How should I give risk feedback and what happens under the hood?. Self-remediation with risk policy If you allow users to self-remediate, with Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and self-service password reset (SSPR) in your risk policies, they can unblock themselves when risk is detected. These detections are then considered closed. Users must have previously registered for Azure AD MFA and SSPR for use when risk is detected. Some detections may not raise risk to the level where a user self-remediation would be required but administrators should still evaluate these detections. Administrators may determine that extra measures are necessary like blocking access\n[3]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/questions/670135/unable-to-dismiss-user-risk.html --- Title: Unable to Dismiss User Risk - Microsoft Q&A --- Body: Unable to Dismiss User Risk - Microsoft Q&A 0 DegnJason-8236 asked \u2022 Dec 20 2021 at 11:47 AM|EricInIT-1 commented \u2022 Dec 28 2021 at 9:02 AM Unable to Dismiss User Risk A user is current blocked from signing in due to risk factors.

However, there are known delays with the UX refreshing the \"Risk state\" of dismissed users. As a workaround, refresh the page on the browser level to see the latest user \"Risk state\". Frequently asked questions Why is a user at risk? If you are an Azure AD Identity Protection customer, go to the risky users view and click on an at-risk user. In the drawer at the bottom, tab \u2018Risk history\u2019 will show all the events that led to a user risk change. To see all risky sign-ins for the user, click on \u2018User\u2019s risky sign-ins\u2019. To see all risk detections for this user, click on \u2018User\u2019s risk detections\u2019. Why was my sign-in blocked but Identity Protection didn't generate a risk detection? Sign-ins can be blocked for several reasons. It is important to note that Identity Protection only generates risk detections when correct credentials are used in the authentication request. If a user uses incorrect credentials, it will not be flagged by Identity Protection since there is not of risk of credential compromise unless a bad actor uses the correct credentials. Some reasons a user can be blocked from signing that will not generate an Identity Protection detection include: The IP can be blocked due to malicious activity from the IP address. The IP blocked message does not differentiate whether the credentials were correct or not. If the IP is blocked and correct credentials are not used, it will not generate an Identity Protection detection Smart Lockout can block the account from signing-in after multiple failed attempts A Conditional Access policy can be enforced that uses conditions other than risk level\n[5]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/concept-identity-protection-b2b --- Title: Identity Protection and B2B users - Azure Active Directory ... --- Body: Identity Protection and B2B users - Azure Active Directory | Microsoft Docs Azure Active Directory Identity protection Identity Protection and B2B users Article 09/10/2021 5 minutes to read 5 contributors In this article How to unblock your account How to remediate a user's risk as an administrator How does Identity Protection work for B2B users? Limitations of Identity Protection for B2B collaboration users Next steps Identity Protection detects compromised credentials for Azure AD users. If your credential is detected as compromised, it means that someone else may have your password and be using it illegitimately. To prevent further risk to your account, it is important to securely reset your password so that the bad actor can no longer use your compromised password. Identity Protection marks accounts that may be compromised as \"at risk.\" You can use your organizational credentials to sign-in to another organization as a guest. This process is referred to business-to-business or B2B collaboration. Organizations can configure policies to block users from signing-in if their credentials are considered at risk. If your account is at risk and you are blocked from signing-in to another organization as a guest, you may be able to self-remediate your account using the following steps. If your organization has not enabled self-service password reset, your administrator will need to manually remediate your account. How to unblock your account If you are attempting to sign-in to another organization as a guest and are blocked due to risk, you will see the following block message: \"Your account is blocked. We've detected suspicious activity on your account.\" If your organization enables it, you can use self-service password reset unblock your account and get your credentials back to a safe state. Go to the Password reset portal and initiate the password reset. If self-service password reset is not enabled for your account and you cannot proceed, reach out to your IT administrator with the information below. If self-service password reset is enabled for your account, you will be prompted to verify your identity using security methods prior to changing your password. For assistance, see the Reset your work or school password article. Once you have successfully and securely reset your password, your user risk will be remediated.

It indicates the probability that an account has been compromised. The risk state can be categorized as low, medium, or high based on the detected risk factors and the user's behavior. The risk state helps administrators identify and prioritize users who may require remediation actions to mitigate potential security risks. When dismissing user risk, it's important to consider the risk state to ensure appropriate actions are taken to address any potential threats."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is user risk policy in Azure AD?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In Azure AD Identity Protection, a user risk policy allows organizations to define specific actions or requirements for users based on their risk level. This policy helps organizations manage and mitigate potential security risks associated with user accounts. The user risk policy can be configured to enforce actions such as requiring users to reset their passwords, blocking user access, or prompting for multi-factor authentication when the risk level is elevated. By defining a user risk policy, organizations can proactively protect their environment and take appropriate remediation actions based on the risk level of individual user accounts."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can Azure AD be hacked?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Azure AD, like any other system, can be vulnerable to hacking if proper security measures are not in place. However, Microsoft continuously invests in security and regularly updates Azure AD to protect against known vulnerabilities and emerging threats. Azure AD provides various security features such as multi-factor authentication, conditional access policies, and risk-based identity protection to help prevent unauthorized access and protect user identities. It is important for organizations to follow security best practices, keep their systems up to date, and implement appropriate security measures to minimize the risk of hacking."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is better  Azure AD or AD FS"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The choice between Azure AD and AD FS depends on your specific requirements and preferences. \n\nAzure AD (Azure Active Directory) is a cloud-based identity and access management service provided by Microsoft. It offers a range of features and capabilities, including user management, single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), conditional access policies, and integration with various applications and services. Azure AD is designed to be highly scalable, resilient, and easy to manage.\n\nAD FS (Active Directory Federation Services) is an on-premises identity federation solution that allows for SSO between an organization's on-premises Active Directory environment and cloud-based applications or services. AD FS authenticates users against the on-premises Active Directory and issues security tokens that enable SSO to cloud resources.\n\nHere are a few considerations when choosing between Azure AD and AD FS:\n\n1. Cloud vs. On-Premises: Azure AD is a cloud-based solution, while AD FS is an on-premises solution. If you prefer a cloud-based identity management solution and want to leverage the scalability, flexibility, and security features of the cloud, Azure AD may be the better option. AD FS may be a suitable choice if you have specific on-premises requirements or need to integrate with legacy systems.\n\n2. Deployment and Management: Azure AD is a fully managed service provided by Microsoft, which means that Microsoft handles the infrastructure and maintenance. AD FS requires infrastructure setup and management on your own servers. Consider your organization's resources, expertise, and preference for managing infrastructure when making a decision.\n\n3. Integration and Compatibility: Azure AD is tightly integrated with various Microsoft services and applications, such as Office 365, Azure services, and Microsoft 365. It also supports integration with third-party applications through standards like SAML, OAuth, and OpenID Connect. AD FS offers more flexibility in terms of integrating with a wider range of applications and services, including those that may not support modern authentication protocols.\n\n4. Hybrid Scenarios: If you have a hybrid IT environment with a mix of on-premises and cloud resources, AD FS may be a better choice as it enables SSO between on-premises Active Directory and cloud services. Azure AD also provides features for hybrid scenarios, such as Azure AD Connect, which allows for synchronization of on-premises identities to Azure AD.\n\nUltimately, the choice between Azure AD and AD FS depends on your specific requirements, infrastructure, and preferences. It may be beneficial to evaluate your organization's needs, consider the features and capabilities of each solution, and consult with your IT team or a Microsoft representative to determine the best fit for your organization."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Does Azure AD store passwords?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, Azure AD does not store passwords in plain text. Azure AD uses industry-standard password hashing algorithms with additional security measures like salting and stretching to securely store and protect user passwords. When a user enters their password, Azure AD hashes and compares it with the stored hashed password to verify their identity. This ensures that even if the Azure AD database were to be compromised, the actual passwords would not be exposed. It is always recommended to follow best practices for password security, such as using strong and unique passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication, and regularly reviewing and updating password policies."}], "topic": "azure ad dismiss user risk"}, {"_id": "65c9bac3f174b2897703777e", "ref_url": null, "openai_model": "gpt-35-turbo-16k", "dialogue_version": 0, "ref": null, "messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!

Some of the limitations include:\n\n1. Conditional Access policies only apply to cloud apps and services that support Azure AD authentication. If an app or service does not support Azure AD authentication, you will not be able to enforce conditional access controls.\n\n2. Some features and capabilities of Conditional Access policies may require specific licensing. For example, enforcing policies based on device compliance requires an Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 license.\n\n3. Conditional Access policies can only be applied to users and groups within your organization's Azure AD tenant. You cannot apply policies to guest users or external users who are accessing your organization's resources.\n\n4. Conditional Access policies do not apply to legacy authentication protocols such as POP3, IMAP, or SMTP. These protocols do not support the necessary Azure AD authentication methods.\n\n5. Conditional Access policies cannot be applied to certain Azure AD administrative roles, such as Global Administrator or Cloud Application Administrator. These roles are exempt from Conditional Access policies to ensure administrative access is not inadvertently blocked.\n\nIt's always a good idea to review the documentation and check for any specific limitations or requirements for the features you want to utilize in your Conditional Access policies."}, {"role": "user", "content": "examples of conditional access time based?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Examples of conditional access policies that are time-based include:\n\n1. Restricting access during specific hours: You can create a policy that restricts access to certain apps or resources during specific hours of the day. For example, you can block access to sensitive data outside of regular working hours or only allow access during business hours.\n\n2. Enforcing access only during specific time frames: You can create a policy that enforces access to certain apps or resources only during specific time frames. For example, you can allow access to a collaboration tool only during project meetings or enable access to critical systems only during maintenance windows.\n\n3. Temporarily granting access for specific periods: You can create a policy that grants temporary access to certain apps or resources for a specific duration. For example, you can allow contractors or vendors access to specific resources for a limited time period, after which their access will be automatically revoked.\n\nThese time-based conditional access policies can help organizations enforce security controls and align access to specific business needs and timeframes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Anything else I should know about "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here are a couple more things you should know about Conditional Access policies:\n\n1. Conditional Access policies can be used in combination with other security features: Conditional Access can be combined with other security features in Azure Active Directory, such as Azure AD Identity Protection and Azure AD Privileged Identity Management. This allows organizations to create a layered approach to security and ensure that access controls are applied at multiple levels for maximum protection.\n\n2. It's important to carefully plan and test your Conditional Access policies: Before implementing Conditional Access policies, it's recommended to thoroughly plan and test your policies in a controlled environment. This will help you understand the impact on end users, identify any potential issues, and ensure that the policies align with your organization's security and compliance requirements.\n\nRemember that the use of Conditional Access policies should be part of a comprehensive security strategy and should be regularly reviewed and updated as your organization's requirements evolve.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "thanks"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You're welcome!

General purpose VM sizes provide balanced CPU-to-memory ratio. Ideal for testing and development, small to medium databases, and low to medium traffic web servers. This article provides information about the offerings for general purpose computing. The Av2-series VMs can be deployed on a variety of hardware types and processors. A-series VMs have CPU performance and memory configurations best suited for entry level workloads like development and test. The size is throttled, based upon the hardware, to offer consistent processor performance for the running instance, regardless of the hardware it is deployed on. To determine the physical hardware on which this size is deployed, query the virtual hardware from within the Virtual Machine. Example use cases include development and test servers, low traffic web servers, small to medium databases, proof-of-concepts, and code repositories. B-series burstable VMs are ideal for workloads that do not need the full performance of the CPU continuously, like web servers, small databases and development and test environments. These workloads typically have burstable performance requirements. The B-Series provides these customers the ability to purchase a VM size with a price conscious baseline performance that allows the VM instance to build up credits when the VM is utilizing less than its base performance. When the VM has accumulated credit, the VM can burst above the VM\u2019s baseline using up to 100% of the CPU when your application requires the higher CPU performance. The DCv2-series can help protect the confidentiality and integrity of your data and code while it\u2019s processed in the public cloud. These machines are backed by the latest generation of Intel XEON E-2288G Processor with SGX technology. With the Intel Turbo Boost Technology these machines can go up to 5.0GHz. DCv2 series instances enable customers to build secure enclave-based applications to protect their code and data while it\u2019s in use. Dv2 and Dsv2-series VMs, a follow-on to the original D-series, features a more powerful CPU and optimal CPU-to-memory configuration making them suitable for most production workloads.

These new sizes introduce Hyper-Threading Technology running on the Intel\u00ae Broadwell E5\u20132673 v4 2.3GHz processor, and the Intel\u00ae Haswell 2.4 GHz E5\u20132673 v3. The shift from physical cores to virtual CPU\u2019s (vCPU) is a key architectural change that enables Azure to unlock the full potential of the latest processors to support even larger VM sizes. These new Hyper-Threaded sizes will be priced up to 28% lower than the previous Dv2 / DSv2 sizes. Let\u2019s try to compare the compute performance different with DSv2 and DSv3. Detail Test Setup: OS Version = Windows Server 2016 Datacenter CPU-Z Version = 1.82.0.x64 Cinebench Version = R15.038 NovaBench CPU-Z Result from D8s_v3 CPU-Z Result from DS4_v2 Cinebench R15.038 Result from D8s_v3 Cinebench R15.038 Result from DS4_v2 Novabench Result from D8s_v3 Novabench Result from DS4_v2 Result Finding: Result is expected on CPU Core vs Hyper-Threading performance comparison. Dv3 / DSv3 should be good option for lower price per core. But if you need performance commitment from physical CPU Core, Dv2 / DSv2 should be your best friend.

The only difference I can see between these two sizes i that the d2s_v3 has 16GB of temporary storage. From what I've read, this may be used for the page file in windows. Is there any reason to stick with the d2s_v3 over the v4? does the v4 have any benefits over the v3?

Just remember... when you stop the vm from the portal, everything on the temp drive is lost. There is a file on the drive that warns if this Had a dev put a bunch of backups and scripts on temp drive and was horrified she lost them. 2 level 1 iwipemyown \u00b7 1 yr. ago I almost said this change is one of the most frustrating things Microsoft has done, but they\u2019ve done so much frustrating shit, I really don\u2019t know if it makes the list. Anyway... when you create a VM with or without the temp disk, you can never switch SKU to the other (with/without). Doesn\u2019t matter if you fully deallocate, change family, sacrifice a lamb, you can\u2019t do it. The only option is to destroy the VM. This also means you can\u2019t upgrade from a Ds_v3 to Dd_v4.

Since I'm part of the Azure Security Center team and this looks like a networking issue, I've removed the \"azure-security-center\" tag and have reached out to our Networking team to look into this issue. In the meantime, I was able to do some research on this and will post my colleague's answer below. Azure Front Door WAF and Azure App Gateway WAF are very similar in functionality, one of the main differences is where the WAF is applied. Azure Front Door applies the WAF filters at edge locations, way before it gets to the datacenter. App Gateway applies the filter when it enters your VNET via the App Gateway. Your best bet is to choose between the 2 in an application delivery perspective, and then apply whichever WAF you choose. If what you are using is inside of a VNET and inside a single region, App Gateway will be your best bet. For a multi-regional deployment or global route filtering, use Azure Front Door.

Discover where each one will fit the best. By Chris Tozzi, Fixate IO Published: 05 Aug 2021 To get the most from a cloud computing architecture, it's imperative to underpin your infrastructure with the right networking management tools. Microsoft Azure includes an array of load balancing and network management tools, chief among them are Azure Front Door and Azure Application Gateway. Both tools essentially perform the same task but each is suited to a different purpose. And in some cases, they can be used simultaneously. What is Azure Front Door? Azure Front Door is a single global entry point which uses an edge network to create scalable web applications. The fully managed service can be configured as a load balancer for an application that runs on Azure. It operates at Open Systems Interconnection Layer 7, also known as the application layer. This means it manages network traffic related to application content. Some features that improve performance and reliability include the following: split TCP -based Anycast protocol for accelerated performance; back-end resource health probe monitoring; URL path-based routing; Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) offloading and certificate management; integrated Web Application Firewall (WAF); and end-to-end IPv6 connectivity and HTTP/2 protocol native support. How does load balancing work? What is Azure Application Gateway? Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer, also Layer 7, that manages application content traffic. Its setup process is similar to Azure Front Door. Users can create an Application Gateway, as well as a Front Door, using Azure Portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI and ARM templates. It also shares some features with Azure Front Door, such as session affinity and WAF integration. Some if its features to manage traffic include the following: SSL/TLS termination autoscaling zone redundancy static VIP URL-based routing multiple-site hosting WebSocket and HTTP/2 traffic native support What are the differences? While Front Door and Application Gateway can both manage Layer 7 traffic, Front Door is a global load balancer while Application Gateway is a regional load balancer. This means that Front Door is better suited in the following situations: You use\n[3]: URL: https://peerspot.com/products/comparisons/azure-front-door_vs_microsoft-azure-application-gateway --- Title: Azure Front Door vs Microsoft Azure Application Gateway ... --- Body: Azure Front Door vs Microsoft Azure Application Gateway Comparison 2022 | PeerSpot Home Azure Front Door vs. Microsoft Azure Application Gateway Azure Front Door vs Microsoft Azure Application Gateway comparison Top Review Pros & Cons Pricing Popular Questions Comparisons Azure Front Door vs. Microsoft Azure Application Gateway report Azure Front Door Read 3 Azure Front Door reviews. 9,975 views|8,561 comparisons Microsoft Azure Application Gateway Read 12 Microsoft Azure Application Gateway reviews. 25,481 views|22,836 comparisons Q&A Highlights Question: What's the difference between Azure Front Door and Application Gateway? Answer: We found Azure Front Door to be easily scaled and very stable. The implementation is very fast and Microsoft provides excellent support. Azure Front Door can quickly detect abnormalities before the traffic comes into the application. Azure Front Door is a very affordable global solution. It would be better, though, if the solution worked with multiple cloud defenders. Currently, it can only be used with the Azure cloud. The WAF feature with Azure Application Gateway is extremely valuable to us. It is a key feature we were looking for in a traffic load balancer. Azure Application Gateway integrates well with other solutions and we have found it to be excellent at catching attacks and stopping suspicious content. It is a regional solution that has no limitations in terms of scalability. We would like to see the monitoring improved, with better reporting capabilities. We would also like to see Azure Application Gateway allow for better filtering on traffic protocols; sometimes traffic that should have been allowed access has been cut off due to strict security presets. If we could see everything that was going on in the system, it would make the security center in Azure Application Gateway much better. Conclusion: These two solutions are similarly effective in the services and features they provide. They both offer great pricing and outstanding support. There are even some scenarios where Azure Application Gateway should be deployed behind Azure Front Door. The major difference is that Azure Front Door is a global service and Azure Application Gateway is a regional service, so they have very different capabilities. We were looking for a regional solution to satisfy our client and we found the added WAF feature of the Azure Application Gateway a much-desired feature for our team and our clients with specific regional needs. We also found that Azure Application Gateway integrated better with more solutions and\n[4]: URL: https://kvaes.wordpress.com/2020/04/13/azure-what-do-i-put-in-front-of-my-web-application --- Title: Azure : What do I put in front of my (web) application ... --- Body: Azure : What do I put in front of my (web) application? \u2013 Karim Vaes Karim Vaes The insights of a Quirky Tech Enthousiast on his journey through the fast paced IT landscape.

Or better said \u2026 What is the difference between the following services? Azure CDN vs Azure Front Door versus Azure Application Gateway (WAF) vs Azure Traffic Manager TL;DR If you do not want to go through the entire post, here is a brief summary of the different options ; My gut feeling tells me this will already help out like a lot! Web Application Firewall (WAF) : Azure Front Door vs Azure Application Gateway Both Azure Front Door and Azure Application Gatewa y state that they can be configured to act as a Web Application Firewall. They key difference here is that the Azure Application Gateway can do a \u201cdetection only\u201d-mode and that it supports CRS 2.2.9, 3.0, and 3.1. This means that there are out-of-the-box rules that provide a baseline security against most of the top-10 vulnerabilities that Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) identifies. With Azure Front Door, you need to configure the rules yourself to your liking. In terms of networking, there also is a very important difference between both. An Azure Application Gateway can be deployed (injected) in(to) an Azure VNET (Virtual Network). By doing so, the traffic between this gateway and your internal backend will flow through a private network. With Azure Front Door, your backend is always based on a public endpoint. Though you can harden / lock down the connectivity between Azure Front Door and your application by restricting the ingress of the traffic. Geographic Redundancy : Azure Front Door vs Azure Traffic Manager If you want to publish your webapp across regions, then you can leverage Azure Front Door or Azure Traffic Manager to do so. The most important thing to know is that Azure Traffic Manager is DNS based and serves as a redirection mechanism. Azure Front Door will serve as an entrypoint (think reverse proxy). So when using Traffic Manager, you will typically look\n[5]: URL: https://tutorialsdojo.com/azure-load-balancer-vs-app-gateway-vs-traffic-manager --- Title: Azure Load Balancer vs Application Gateway vs Traffic ... --- Body: Azure Load Balancer vs Application Gateway vs Traffic Manager vs Front Door - Tutorials Dojo Azure Load Balancer vs Application Gateway vs Traffic Manager vs Front Door Load Balancer Application Gateway Traffic Manager Front Door Service Network load balancer.

In this blog post, I will share some best practice guidelines to help you get the most out of your Azure Virtual Machines. These guidelines come straight out of customer feedback and cover some of the most common problems they have encountered. Avoid Configuring Single VMs in an Availability Set When a virtual machine is deployed in Azure it can be configured to be either part of an availability set or to have the availability set configured to \u2018None\u2019. The \u2018None\u2019 option can be slightly misleading because everyone would like their VM to be highly available, right? However, I only recommend selecting an availability set when 2 or more virtual machines are deployed to provide the same functionality. If the VM you are deploying is not part of a set of VMs (i.e., 2 or more) that provide the same functionality, such as multiple web servers under a common load balancer or two SQL Servers that are replicating data. If the VM you are deploying is not part of a set of VMs that provide the same functionality, then you should select \u2018None\u2019. You may ask yourself, \u201cWhy is it bad to deploy single VMs in an availability set?\u201d Simply put, if you deploy a single VM instance within an availability set, you will receive no advanced warning or notification of platform maintenance. In this configuration, your single VM instance can and will be rebooted with no advanced warning when platform maintenance occurs. If you deploy your single VM instance and set the availability set option to \u2018None\u2019, you will receive notification prior to your VM being rebooted for platform maintenance operations and help ensure that your single VM instance is not rebooted without you understanding when and why. Behind the scenes, when VMs are deployed to an availability set the Azure platform ensures that only a subset of the VMs in the availability set are taken down for platform maintenance at any one time. So when you have multiple VMs in\n[2]: URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55728381/is-there-any-way-do-create-a-vm-in-azure-without-temporary-storage-drive --- Title: Is there any way do create a vm in azure without temporary ... --- Body: powershell - Is there any way do create a vm in azure without temporary storage drive? - Stack Overflow Is there any way do create a vm in azure without temporary storage drive?

But if you know what specific attribute you are looking for, you can easily find the corresponding cmdlet (if one exists). Here's also a reference for what's available via the Graph API (again, not everything is listed): https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/user?view=graph-rest-1.0 To add custom attributes, follow the steps here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/azure/ad/graph/howto/azure-ad-graph-api-directory-schema-extensions \u00b7 4 Thanks for your quick response, For example, I have a test user call TestUser.

This is by design and ensures that if you have complex attributes on user objects you don't suddenly end up with a huge response object. Graph API supports OData queries which allow you to specify explicitly which properties you retrieve (and, no, there is no \"select *\" to retrieve all), the downside being you need to know the name of the properties you wish to read. Graph Explorer is a good way to familiarise yourself with how queries work, which you can then use in a Graph Client. While this is for Azure AD B2C I quite like the Graph Client included in this sample as it is quite simple and should work with the standard AAD Graph API.

Not just the populated ones. Not just the ones visible in AD Users & Computers advanced view. But: ALL OF THEM! I looked around and found a couple of half answers. One post suggested looking at the mayContain and systemMayContain attributes of the User object in the AD Schema. Also, in forums you\u2019ll see partial answers to this intriguing question. To get THE FULL answer you need to understand the way Active Directory schema classes inherit their attributes. Active Directory Classes and Attribute Inheritance In the Active Directory schema you will find all definitions of classes and attributes. A class can be of three types: Structural \u2013 you can create an actual object from this type of class Abstract \u2013 you can inherit from this class but not create an object Auxiliary \u2013 defines supplemental classes implemented by a class A class (of any type) may have up to four lists of attributes included in it\u2019s definition. These lists are defined in the following class attributes: mayContain mustContain systemMayContain systemMustContain Additionally, all classes inherit from a parent class (except the root of all classes, the \u201ctop\u201d class). The following diagram shows you how the user class is designed in the Active Directory schema: It inherits from the organizationPerson class, which again inherits from the person class, which again inherits from the top class. The user class includes the class definition (more attributes!) from a number of supplemental classes as defined in the auxiliaryClass and systemAuxiliaryClass attributes. The user class, all the inherited classes and all the supplemental classes define the attributes that can be included in a user object (in the above diagram the mayContain, mustContain, systemMayContain and systemMustContain are only shown for the user class to keep it simple). Extending AD Management to Include Office 365 Using third-party tools like Easy365Manager allows you to manage Office 365 licenses and mailboxes directly from AD Users & Computers: With Easy365Manager you no longer have to log into to multiple web consoles and have an on-premises Exchange Server to manage your hybrid Office 365 environment.

Filter for guest users in the directory Convert UserType Remove guest user limitations Can I make guest users visible in the Exchange Global Address List? Can I update a guest user's email address? Next steps B2B collaboration is a capability of Azure AD External Identities that lets you collaborate with users and partners outside of your organization. With B2B collaboration, an external user is invited to sign in to your Azure AD organization using their own credentials. This B2B collaboration user can then access the apps and resources you want to share with them. A user object is created for the B2B collaboration user in the same directory as your employees. B2B collaboration user objects have limited privileges in your directory by default, and they can be managed like employees, added to groups, and so on. This article discusses the properties of this user object and ways to manage it. The following table describes B2B collaboration users based on how they authenticate (internally or externally) and their relationship to your organization (guest or member). External guest: Most users who are commonly considered external users or guests fall into this category. This B2B collaboration user has an account in an external Azure AD organization or an external identity provider (such as a social identity), and they have guest-level permissions in the resource organization. The user object created in the resource Azure AD directory has a UserType of Guest. External member: This B2B collaboration user has an account in an external Azure AD organization or an external identity provider (such as a social identity) and member-level access to resources in your organization. This scenario is common in organizations consisting of multiple tenants, where users are considered part of the larger organization and need member-level access to resources in the organization\u2019s other tenants. The user object created in the resource Azure AD directory has a UserType of Member. Internal guest: Before Azure AD B2B collaboration was available, it was common to collaborate with distributors, suppliers, vendors, and others by setting up internal credentials for\n[5]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/user-profile-attributes --- Title: User profile attributes in Azure Active Directory B2C ... --- Body: User profile attributes in Azure Active Directory B2C | Microsoft Docs Azure Active Directory B2C User profile attributes Article 03/28/2022 12 minutes to read 9 contributors In this article Azure AD user resource type Required attributes Display name attribute Identities attribute Password profile property Password policy attribute MFA phone number attribute Extension attributes Next steps Your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) B2C directory user profile comes with a built-in set of attributes, such as given name, surname, city, postal code, and phone number. You can extend the user profile with your own application data without requiring an external data store. Most of the attributes that can be used with Azure AD B2C user profiles are also supported by Microsoft Graph. This article describes supported Azure AD B2C user profile attributes. It also notes those attributes that are not supported by Microsoft Graph, as well as Microsoft Graph attributes that should not be used with Azure AD B2C. Important You should not use built-in or extension attributes to store sensitive personal data, such as account credentials, government identification numbers, cardholder data, financial account data, healthcare information, or sensitive background information. You can also integrate with external systems. For example, you can use Azure AD B2C for authentication, but delegate to an external customer relationship management (CRM) or customer loyalty database as the authoritative source of customer data. For more information, see the remote profile solution.

Previously, tools such as VBA, SSIS, C# and more have been used to perform this data ingestion orchestration process. Recently, Microsoft introduced an Excel connector for Azure Data Factory. Based on this new Excel connector, how can we go about loading Excel files containing multiple tabs into Azure SQL Database Tables? Solution With the new addition of the Excel connector in Azure Data Factory, we now have the capability of leveraging dynamic and parameterized pipelines to load Excel spreadsheets into Azure SQL Database tables. In this article, we will explore how to dynamically load an Excel spreadsheet residing in ADLS gen2 containing multiple Sheets into a single Azure SQL Table and also into multiple tables for every sheet. Pre-Requisites Create an Excel Spreadsheet The image below shows a sample Excel spreadsheet containing four sheets containing the same headers and schema that we will use in our ADF Pipelines to load data in Azure SQL Tables. Upload to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 This same Excel spreadsheet has been loaded to ADLS gen2. Within Data Factory, we can add an ADLS gen2 linked service for the location of the Excel spreadsheet. Create Linked Services and Datasets We'll need to ensure that the ADLS gen2 linked service credentials are configured accurately. When creating a new dataset, notice that we have Excel format as an option which we can select. The connection configuration properties for the Excel dataset can be found below. Note that we will need to configure the Sheet Name property with the dynamic parameterized @dataset().SheetName value. Also, since we have headers in the file, we will need to check 'First row as header'. Within the parameters tab, we'll need to add SheetName. Next, a sink dataset to the target Azure SQL Table will also need to be created with a connection to the appropriate linked service.

Firstly I validated that the deployment steps had been followed and that the VM Extension for Linux had been attached to the expected virtual machine (CentOS), all checked out fine. Originally the concern was that the firewall wasn\u2019t sending the syslog data, but a quick packet capture on the WAN interfaces dismissed these concerns. For reference, we were using UDP 514 as standard. Great, we know our traffic is leaving fine, as we can\u2019t review our ISP\u2019s network, our next troubleshooting step is to make sure it\u2019s being received by the Azure virtual machine at the other end. To do this, next we looked at the Network Security Group (NSG) defined on the Linux Log Analytics virtual machine to determine if the traffic was being blocked on the Azure side. I validated the public IP address and port our traffic was originating from matched the NSG rule and it should be being passed through absolutely fine. Now we know there was no external reason for the traffic to be blocked, I moved onto the virtual machine itself. I checked whether the virtual machine itself had any firewall enabled, and it didn\u2019t. At this point I decided to query the virtual machine to confirm if it was listening for the traffic, and I found something unusual. To do so I ran the following command sudo netstat -tunlp The output was surprising, whilst I saw the rsyslogd process was listening, it wasn\u2019t listening on port 514 as expected, instead it was listening on a port high in the 30,000 range. A common reason for this to happen is if the intended port is already bound, some applications will set a dynamic port to continue to function. However nothing was using the 514 port. I validated this wasn\u2019t a deployment error by removing the Log Analytics Agent, rebooting and then connecting the Log Analytics Agent again, the issue persisted and the port was changing across any subsequent reboots. At this point I reviewed the rsyslog.conf file (located at /etc/rsyslog.conf and found the problem.

I haven\u2019t had enough time to compare all of the features and capabilities so go easy on me! This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve blogged about SSO, but this is the first time that I\u2019m taking a look a deeper look at the Identity-as-a-Service space (IdaaS as it\u2019s known). For the typical enterprise use cases I\u2019ve encountered previously, I\u2019ve been totally satisfied with AD FS and Microsoft\u2019s now retired Windows Azure Access Control Service product, which was retired this April . I find that to be a shame because it really was \u201cAD FS in the cloud\u201d. It was extremely easy to use, easy to setup, and easy to manage \u2014 even in the old, gen 1 Silverlight based console that never got updated. Of course it lacked a lot of features compared to Auth0, Okta, and even Azure AD that define this emerging space. Tools like Auth0, Okta, and Azure AD add many integrated capabilities that enterprises expect today in an identity management platform such as multi-factor authentication, activity tracking, anomaly detection, and user management among other things. There is currently no production ready functionality that matches Azure ACS. Instead Microsoft somewhat fragmented their offerings with Azure Active Directory, Azure Active Directory B2B (a subset of Azure AD), and Azure Active Directory B2C. Of these three solutions, only B2C offers true federation capabilities which is still in preview mode using what is known as Custom Policies. Azure AD and B2B work great \u2014 as long as you don\u2019t need/want direct federation. Microsoft has a handy page with a good comparison of the two ( note that direct federation is a future feature of Azure AD B2B so we could see B2C eventually folded into a single offering) and Tomasz Onyszko has a good write up with details that I\u2019ll quote: Azure AD is an identity as a service provider aimed at organization users to provide and control access to cloud resources Azure AD B2B is not a separate service but a feature in Azure AD. It allows cross-organization collaboration in applications from an identity\n[3]: URL: https://jumpcloud.com/blog/auth0-vs-azure-ad --- Title: Auth0 vs Azure AD - JumpCloud --- Body: Auth0 vs Azure AD - JumpCloud Auth0 vs Azure AD Written by Zach DeMeyer on August 17, 2019 Blog Home > User Management > Auth0 vs Azure AD As the world continues to shift to the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model of application delivery, developers are starting to find ways to make their process more manageable. One such avenue is the use of customer identity and access management (IAM) solutions to off-load the chore of managing end user databases. In the era of microservices, developers look at these types of solutions as cloud user directory services for their applications. In this category, many are comparing Auth0 \u00ae vs Azure \u00ae Active Directory \u00ae, and more specifically, the B2C (business-to-customer) version of the Microsoft \u00ae Azure product. A Good Comparison For application developers, this part of their web application or mobile app is not often a market differentiator, so offloading it to organizations like Auth0 or Azure Active Directory (AAD) B2C makes a lot of sense. Both Auth0 and Azure AD are effective at aiding DevOps organizations with simplifying the management of a customer user database. Beyond that, they can also help with all of the management of permissions, auditing, password resets, and everything else involved with this process. When it comes to actually comparing the two products, the general consensus is that the two are fairly neck and neck. Across many of today\u2019s popular review platforms, both Auth0 and Azure AD B2C score around the same in most categories. A key differentiator between them is the fact that, as a Microsoft offering, Azure AD B2C is more inclined towards Azure-centric organizations (i.e. teams building applications on Azure). With many of today\u2019s apps being designed in other IaaS platforms such as AWS \u00ae or GCP\u2122, Auth0 might give a leg up in that regard. Bigger Cloud IAM Needs Of course, a major reason for the comparison of Auth0 vs. Azure AD B2C is the fact that much of today\u2019s workloads are being moved to the cloud. Per the RightScale \u00ae 2019 State of the Cloud Report, respondents plan on spending 24% more on public cloud infrastructure than they did in 2018. Everything from applications to file servers are being offered from the cloud, and as organizations consider cloud IAM solutions, it\u2019s only natural that their thoughts lean towards a cloud directory service for internal users (i.e. employees and contractors) as well.

They can be from a partner organisation or they can be end-users. Azure AD supports B2B and B2C mode and each one of them is different. Following are some of the design considerations Are the external consumers from partner organisation or end users? Does the application support integration with external IDp i.e gmail, facebook to name few. Licensing differs for both B2B and B2C This documents the best practices to be used while making the decision We have gone ahead with B2B because we already had Azure Premium License and that supported B2B licensing model.

Leave a comment May 20, 2020 by Kenneth Fisher The other day I got this rather interesting error while connecting to an Azure SQL DB. I was connecting using Azure Active Directory \u2013 Universal with MFA authentication. Unfortunately my Google/Bing-fu wasn\u2019t up to the task of finding a post with the answer. But, after a bunch of searching and testing I did manage to figure it out for myself, so that was good. Simply enough the Active Directory Admin wasn\u2019t set for the Azure SQL Server. If you go to the Overview tab for the server you\u2019ll see this over on the right side. Notice that it currently shows the Active Directory Admin as Not configured. To configure it just click on Not configured or the Active Directory Admin tab under Settings. That will take you to here: From there just hit Set Admin at the top and pick the user or group that will be the admin. Since there can only be one admin, I highly recommend using a group if this is for work. That way multiple people can have access at the same time (for those that have a multi person DBA team this is essential IMO) and because people come and go in any job. This way it\u2019s simple enough to change the membership of the group and not have to change every Azure SQL Server any time your DBA changes. For personal use this is far less important of course.

So after some searching I managed to work out what the root of the issue was and it was very simple to rectify. In order to use Azure Active Directory (AAD) against the SQL Server, you need to configure the AAD administrator (you can choose a user or a group) for the database. You can do this in the portal by browsing to the Azure SQL Server and clicking \u201cActive Directory Admin\u201d. In the page that appears, click \u201cSet Admin\u201d and assign a user or group as the AAD admin. Simple as that! Set Admin Add Admin So I went ahead and added my SQL Administrators group as the AAD administrator and voila! I can now access my new SQL Azure database using Azure Active Directory which is more secure and convenient than using the Server Administrator SQL authentication. NB. You can choose to use an individual Azure Active Directory account, although I would recommend setting up a group in Azure, then you can add the group to all the SQL Azure Databases that need managing. If there are then changes within the SQL admin group then you only need to update the members of the group once instead of updating all the individual AAD administrators on each server.

Article 04/12/2022 2 minutes to read 4 contributors In this article Advantages of subnet delegation Who can delegate? Impact of subnet delegation on your subnet What subnet delegation does not do Next steps Subnet delegation enables you to designate a specific subnet for an Azure PaaS service of your choice that needs to be injected into your virtual network. Subnet delegation provides full control to the customer on managing the integration of Azure services into their virtual networks. When you delegate a subnet to an Azure service, you allow that service to establish some basic network configuration rules for that subnet, which help the Azure service operate their instances in a stable manner. As a result, the Azure service may establish some pre or post deployment conditions, such as: deploy the service in a shared versus dedicated subnet. add to the service a set of Network Intent Policies post deployment that is required for the service to work properly. Advantages of subnet delegation Delegating a subnet to specific services provides the following advantages: helps to designate a subnet for one or more Azure services and manage the instances in the subnet as per requirements. For example, the virtual network owner can define the following for a delegated subnet to better manage resources and access as follows: network filtering traffic policies with network security groups. routing policies with user-defined routes. services integration with service endpoints configurations. helps injected services to better integrate with the virtual network by defining their pre-conditions of deployments in the form of Network Intent Policies. This ensures any actions that can affect functioning of the injected service can be blocked at PUT. Who can delegate? Subnet delegation is an exercise that the virtual network owners need to perform to designate one of the subnets for a specific Azure Service. Azure Service in turn deploys the instances into this subnet for consumption by the customer workloads. Impact of subnet delegation on your subnet Each Azure service defines their own deployment model, where they can define what properties they do or do not support in a delegated subnet for injection purposes, such as follows: shared subnet with other Azure Services or VM / virtual machine scale set in the same subnet, or it only supports a dedicated subnet with only\n[3]: URL: https://reddit.com/r/azure/comments/n8jtou/subnet_delegation_v_creating_a_service_endpoint --- Title: Subnet delegation v creating a service endpoint : AZURE --- Body: Subnet delegation v creating a service endpoint : AZURE 1 Posted by 1 year ago Subnet delegation v creating a service endpoint Technical Question Dear All I have been reading around the subject of service points. I understand the concept of service endpoints when applied to a subnet. In a nut shell it allow you to \"inject\"the PAAS services into your VNET rather then going across the internet. When i look at subnet delegation it looks like its doing the same thing. What is the difference between using subnet delegation and assigning the service endpoint to access a PAAS resource ? 3 comments 100% Upvoted Log in or sign up to leave a comment Log In Sign Up Sort by: best level 1 \u00b7 1 yr. ago A subnet delegation means a service will be delegated the said subnet. A service endpoint is pinned to an IP within the subnet to have a placeholder for that service. Everything in that subnet that needs to talk to that service can communicate with that IP directly. From my understanding, you will delegate subnets with the delegation capability or delegate 1 IP within a subnet with service endpoints. 2 level 2 \u00b7 8 mo. ago Service endpoints are not pinned to any single IP. Those are called Private Endpoints / Private Link. When a Service endpoint is enabled on a subnet, he VMs in that subnet will have the routes associated with that service programmed into their effective route tables. 1 Continue this thread More posts from the AZURE community 56 Posted by 6 days ago I hate that Microsoft uses non-standard / non-ubiquitous terminology General Pretty much that. It's really annoying I have to convert common things to \"Microsoft Speak\". I also don't like that there is a seeming lack of consistency in terminology while reading the documentation. It makes me not want to use Azure. For example, look at the PIM documentation >Azure AD roles \u2013 Sometimes referred to as directory roles, Azure AD roles include built-in and custom roles to manage Azure AD and other Microsoft 365 online services. The key word is _sometimes_. Okay, when are Azure AD roles referred to as Directory Roles? Why not just call them \"Azure AD Roles\" like the documentation does? I know this is a trivial example, but you can imagine these types of inconsistencies are rampant in the Azure documentation. 63 comments\n[4]: URL: https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/305447/how-to-connect-to-sql-managed-instance-on-private-endpoint-on-different-vnet --- Title: sql server - How to connect to SQL managed instance on private endpoint ... --- Body: sql server - How to connect to SQL managed instance on private endpoint on different VNET - Database Administrators Stack Exchange How to connect to SQL managed instance on private endpoint on different VNET 0 I can't connect to SQL managed instance from Azure VM in different VNET.

SQL Server Agent is a powerful component that is used to schedule and execute jobs in SQL server. But in Azure, SQL server agent is available only in managed instances and not in the single databases. To schedule and execute jobs on single databases we have a feature called elastic job agent. This feature is used for scheduling and execute jobs on a single database, all the databases in the server, or on all the databases in an elastic pool. The following are the steps involved in creating an elastic job and scheduling it. Creating an Elastic Job agent Creating credentials on the Agent database in Azure SQL Creating a target group and members Creating logins on target master and user databases Creating job and job steps Schedule the job to execute it on the target database Let\u2019s go over these steps one by one. Creating Elastic Job agent Pre-requisite: we need to have at least one SQL database with a service level objective of S0 or above. To create an elastic job agent, Navigate to the Azure portal and type elastic job in the search box. Select the Elastic Job agents in the list as shown in the below image. On Elastic Job agents page, click on Add. Enter the name of the elastic job agent, choose the subscription. Accept the terms (1). Click on OK (2). Select the Azure SQL database for an elastic job agent (3). The database with the service level objective of S0 or above is eligible for creating an elastic job agent. Click on Create (4). Now Elastic job agent creates few objects (table, procedures, etc) on the database you selected. Once the deployment is completed we can proceed with further steps. Creating database scoped credentials on the agent database On the Agent database, execute the following script by replacing the password with the password of your choice.

To see the Elastic Stack in action, you can optionally connect to Kibana and work with some sample logging data. In this tutorial you learn how to: Create an Ubuntu VM in an Azure resource group Install Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana on the VM Send sample data to Elasticsearch with Logstash Open ports and work with data in the Kibana console This deployment is suitable for basic development with the Elastic Stack. For more on the Elastic Stack, including recommendations for a production environment, see the Elastic documentation and the Azure Architecture Center. Prerequisites Use the Bash environment in Azure Cloud Shell. For more information, see Azure Cloud Shell Quickstart - Bash. If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally, install the Azure CLI. If you are running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container. If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the az login command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For additional sign-in options, see Sign in with the Azure CLI. When you're prompted, install Azure CLI extensions on first use. For more information about extensions, see Use extensions with the Azure CLI. Run az version to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run az upgrade. This article requires version 2.0.4 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

Azure Private Link provides private connectivity between your VNET (Virtual Network) and other Azure resources. Private Link simplifies your cloud network architecture and eliminates data exposure to the public internet by routing your data to private Azure service endpoints. The use of Azure Private Link with Elastic Cloud provides an additional layer of security to help you meet your security policy and compliance requirements. You can take advantage of Azure Private Link across all subscription tiers on Elastic Cloud. In this blog we\u2019ll show you how easy it is to get started. We\u2019ll walk you through the steps to configure Private Link access between your VNET and Elastic Cloud deployment. Step 1: Create a Private Link endpoint using the Elastic Cloud service alias First you\u2019ll need to create a Private Link endpoint using the Azure portal or command line interface (CLI). The Private Link endpoint is assigned a private IP address from your VNET. Create a private endpoint in your VNet using the service alias for your region. Follow the Azure instructions for details on creating a private endpoint to an endpoint service. Use the service aliases for the region in which your Elastic Cloud deployment is hosted. The IP address of the private endpoint is used to create a DNS A record, this will be done in the next step. For example, here is what creating an endpoint for the region East US 2 looks like using the Azure Private Link Service Alias for that region: eastus2-prod-002-privatelink-service.64359fdd-7893-4215-9929-ece3287e1371.eastus2.azure.privatelinkservice. Your endpoint has a private IP address and you can find this through the network interface for the endpoint. Step 2: Create a DNS record for the Private Link endpoint Create a DNS record for your private endpoint and associate it with the VNet your Private Link endpoint resides in (learn more at Azure Private Endpoint DNS Configuration ). Create a Private DNS zone using the Private Hosted Zone domain name listed in our documentation for your region. Associate the VNET your private endpoint resides in. Create a DNS A record pointing to the IP address of the private endpoint. To see detailed\n", "messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!

I\u00b4ve a really anoying problem. When trying to sign in on my university account in Word or Excel (Office 365) I get the error code 700003 stating that \"Your organization has deleted this device\". Everything works online, but when opening Word or Excel on the desktop, then I can\u00b4t sign in. Everything looks ok from the university\u00b4s side and the IT-support couldn\u00b4t help me. I\u00b4ve tried everything (I think). Does anyone know how to solve this? Didn\u00b4t use my computer during June-July and everything was working before that. In August when returning I had this problem.

In addition to that, what device are you using? And to clarify what does it mean when you say \"everything works online, but when opening word or excel on the desktop i can't sign in.\" Does this mean that this is when you get the error 700003? It's also possible that your university has removed offline access to word/excel. Does this work for other students at your university? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Please remember to mark one of the responses as answer if your question has been answered.

Including GPO Auto-enrollment in MEM/Intune. Our first device once GPO enrolled successfully the SSO now behaves in an odd way. In AAD the device prior to enrollment was AAD Registered (ADConnect) and SSO was working smoothly. Now we get the error when accessing MS sites Your organization has deleted this device, To fix this, contact your system administrator and provide the error code 700003. The device appears in AAD as Hybrid AAD Joined, there are no registered devices by the same name Despite the error though, a simple click to continue and the SSO still works and we can access resources. We do not want this to happen to users in production, any thoughts? Thanks Mike Spice (4) Reply (4) flag Report michaelmeyer5 jalapeno check Best Answer OP michaelmeyer5 jalapeno Jul 6th, 2020 at 8:55 PM Update: After several days and nothing simply working itself out in the wash, we took a different approach and it looks to have worked. So what we did, we opened an MS site that was delivering the 700003 SSO error and let it login and take us to the page. We then logged out of that site altogether (Sign Out) We then ran the command \"dsregcmd /leave\" elevated We immediately rebooted and allowed the GPO to re-enrol the device, it did this all OK. We no longer get the error and SSO is working smoothly across all MS sites that were once giving the error.

It's very annoying because it means I have to re- sign in all the time. As far as I can tell the device *is* properly registered in Company Portal. If I load up my Azure AD profile I can see the device. If I go into Company Portal modern app it says my device has access. If I go into Settings -> Accounts it says \"Connected to MDM\" I have tried dsregcmd /join from the SYSTEM command prompt but that hasn't done anything. dsregcmd /status says: +----------------------------------------------------------------------+|Device State|+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ AzureAdJoined: NO EnterpriseJoined: NO DomainJoined: NO +----------------------------------------------------------------------+|User State|+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ NgcSet: NO WorkplaceJoined: YES WorkAccountCount:2 WamDefaultSet: NO +----------------------------------------------------------------------+| SSO State|+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ AzureAdPrt: NO AzureAdPrtAuthority: NO EnterprisePrt: NO EnterprisePrtAuthority: NO +----------------------------------------------------------------------+|Work Account 1|+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ WorkplaceDeviceId:*** WorkplaceThumbprint:*** WorkplaceIdp: login.windows.net WorkplaceTenantId:*** WorkplaceTenantName:*** WorkplaceMdmUrl:WorkplaceSettingsUrl:NgcSet: NO +----------------------------------------------------------------------+|Work Account 2|+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ WorkplaceDeviceId:*** WorkplaceThumbprint:*** WorkplaceIdp: login.windows.net WorkplaceTenantId:*** WorkplaceTenantName:*** WorkplaceMdmUrl:WorkplaceSettingsUrl:NgcSet: NO +----------------------------------------------------------------------+|Ngc Prerequisite Check|+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ IsDeviceJoined: NO IsUserAzureAD: NO PolicyEnabled: YES PostLogonEnabled: YES DeviceEligible: YES SessionIsNotRemote: YES CertEnrollment: none PreReqResult:WillNotProvision Tuesday, June 25, 2019 2:16 AM All replies 2 Sign in to vote Hello coxymla , The device thinks that it is still joined . We would suggest to completely unjoin the device before trying to join again . Please follow the following steps. Make sure you have disabled group policy for automatic device registration . Please download Psexec tool locally on the machine. Start a command prompt (cmd.exe) with administrative Privileges. Once done , please navigate to the folder where you have extracted the PSexec tool. Run the command \"psexec -sid cmd.exe\" without quotes. Once done a new command prompt will pop up with needed privileges . This command prompt is opened in a system context so now we would run the following to un-register the device completely. dsregcmd /leave Once done , please reboot the machine and logon again to check the status using dsregcmd /status . It should work . In case you still have errors , please let us know. Thank you.

To fix this, contact your system administrator and provide the error code 700003\u2032. How to Fix Office 365 Error 700003 1. Use Office 365 online If you really need to use your Office 365 account and you don\u2019t have enough time to try to troubleshoot this issue, you can access Word or Excel online. Error code 700003 prevents Office apps from running on the desktop, but everything should work just fine online. 2. Disconnect the problematic account Disconnecting the account that triggered error 70003 is another quick solution that could potentially solve this problem. Open the Settings app Go to Accounts Select Access work or school Find the account that you can\u2019t use and select Disconnect Wait until the account is disconnected Try to login to Office again using your regular username and password. 3. Delete the problematic account If disconnecting the account didn\u2019t work, you can try to delete it from your computer. Launch the Settings app Navigate to Accounts Select the Access work or school option Delete the account Sign into your Outlook profile again. 4. Remove the device completely This solution is a complex one. Use it only if you\u2019re an advanced user or an IT admin. Disable group policy for automatic device registration. If the respective setting is already configured in your environment, you should find it on the machine. If the entry is not available, that means it\u2019s not configured on your machine and you don\u2019t need to do anything. Download the Psexec tool and extract it to the PSTools folder Launch Command Prompt as an administrator Open the PSexec folder Run the psexec -sid cmd.exe command A new command prompt will appear on the screen (in a system context) To un-register the device, run the dsregcmd /leave command Restart your machine Check your machine\u2019s status using dsregcmd /status. 5. Remove the account and the device This solution is some sort of a hybrid between the third and the fourth solutions. For some users, utilizing the respective solutions individually didn\u2019t work.

Both App service and Cloud service are hosted on virtual machines, developers have more control over virtual machines while using Cloud service. Cloud service provides the user with more flexibility while automatically managing the app container. In this article, we will run a comparison between App Service, Cloud Service and Service Fabric. Also Read: Azure vs AWS: Best Cloud Service for Serverless Architecture App Service Azure App Service is a platform as a service (PaaS) by Microsoft. It runs on a set of virtual machines in both dedicated and shared mode based on your plan. The four major types of App services are: Web App, API App, Logic App, and Mobile App. The benefits of using App Service are aplenty. Among the various advantages a few worth mentioning are that it is easier and faster to deploy than Cloud services. The deployment slots are free with built-in A/B testing features and are extendable with site extensions. There are a few disadvantages as well such as no access to the server, inability to use all monitoring tools, limited Windows performance and VM sizes to choose from. With the Azure App service you can develop the following apps: Web App: It is available for both Linux and Windows and gives developers more control to deploy and scale web apps in different languages such as Java, PHP and more. Web App for Containers: This one lets developers use their Docker formatted container images as well as deploy and run them. Functions App: This is used on the serverless computing enabling building of the serverless functions that can be auto-scaled. API App: With this, the developers can easily host, build and use APIs coded in different languages. They can also benefit from features like connectivity to on-premise resources or turnkey API security. Logic App: By using this the developers can create workflows triggered to execute specific steps with each step triggering an API app to handle certain functions.

The comparisons are only approximate but representative of the underlying cost structure. Unless there are hard Windows server dependencies, switching to AKS will save 30%+ and AKS is fully supported by Microsoft tools like Visual Studio and Azure DevOps. Cost Comparison between Azure Kubernetes vs. App Services A few other notes and interesting facts uncovered while working on this cost analysis: The discount between Monthly and Dev/Test VM pricing appears to be the license cost of Windows server. Linux VMs pricing is the same as Windows Dev/Test pricing and there is no additional discount. AKS does not support the instance sizes of the smallest App Service Plans. The documentation of the instance sizes used is for the Premium v2 tier. Only the Premium Tier of App Service Plans has SSD storage. App Service does support Linux but with only 5% discount over Windows Lack of equivalents for App Service Storage sizes in AKS and VM \u2014 next highest size was selected Pricing represents a single instance and would rise as instances are added to the App Service plans or AKS clusters Price savings of AKS over equivalent App Service Plans increases with higher App Service Plan Tiers Cost of AKS nodes similar to cost of VMs running Linux but there is a small discount with D_v2 instances Syntax of Node column in the table is \u201cinstance type\u201d + \u201cstorage type\u201d: storage size No pricing for Windows containers under AKS until GA App Services are legacy technology for Microsoft Azure \u2014 no major announcements or blog posts since 2017. 3 3 More from Nature of Clouds Reflections on the fundamental nature of cloud computing and open source\n[3]: URL: https://cwienczek.com/2018/10/azure-app-service-vs-aks-vs-service-fabric --- Title: Azure App Service vs AKS vs Service Fabric | cwienczek.com --- Body: Azure App Service vs AKS vs Service Fabric | cwienczek.com Azure App Service vs AKS vs Service Fabric Oct 1, 2018 Tags: Kubernetes AKS Service Fabric App Service Azure App Service Azure Cloud DevOps Categories: Software Development Azure App Service vs AKS vs Service Fabric Because my previous article turned out to be very popular, I decided to make a followup article that extends the comparison of Azure Kubernetes Service and Service Fabric to Azure App Services for Linux (Docker). This is a very reasonable alternative for most of developers that are starting with containers and want to begin their journey with containers. If you haven\u2019t read my previous article, you can find it here: Kubernetes vs Azure Service Fabric DISCLAIMER Some parts of this article do not apply to Azure App Service for Windows or Linux without containers. Azure App Service vs other stuff Neither AKS nor Service Fabric is a \u201cfully managed\u201d service. Azure gives you SLA only on the underlying virtual machine infrastructure. This means that neither Kubernetes, nor Service Fabric will give you guarantee that your applications still work after any cluster-level failure. I will not go into detail what a cluster-level failure means for me, but I can tell you there is a lot that can happen when you orchestrate tens/hundreds of containers on a set of predefined machines. This also means that you need an automation system in place, in case of a failure. Sometimes you even need a dedicated team of engineers, that monitors your cluster 24/7. There are many intricacies and nuances of running a Kubernetes cluster. The amount of effort to prepare and maintain a Kubernetes environment is non-trivial. Side note I believe there are exceptions to these rules. Small clusters that are not mission-critical are also a viable option for small businesses. I had been running production workloads without any interruption for almost half a year on a small Kubernetes cluster. It all depends on what a production-ready cluster is for you. App Service for Linux - the good parts Azure App Service for Linux is much easier to manage than Kubernetes and Service Fabric. It is a fully managed service, which means that there is an SLA guarantee on your application working in the environment. Azure App Service is easy to scale. You get automatic scaling, such as by CPU usage, out-of-the-box. App Services also provide you with free\n[4]: URL: https://github.com/undergroundwires/azure-in-bullet-points --- Title: \ue000GitHub\ue001 - \ue000undergroundwires/Azure-in-bullet-points\ue001: \u2601\ufe0f Azure ... --- Body: GitHub - undergroundwires/Azure-in-bullet-points: \u2601\ufe0f Azure summary in bullet points master 4 branches 0 tags Go to file Code Manish2208 and undergroundwires Improve micro-services #38 \u2026 1ee2c85 on Mar 8 81 commits .github add donation information 14 months ago AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator Fix minor typo #35 2 months ago AZ-303 Microsoft Azure Architect Technologies Rename Office 365 to Microsoft 365 3 months ago AZ-304 Microsoft Azure Architect Design Rename Office 365 to Microsoft 365 3 months ago AZ-400 Microsoft Azure DevOps Solutions Rename Office 365 to Microsoft 365 3 months ago AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals Improve micro-services #38 2 months ago tools initial commit 3 years ago .gitignore lint + automate linting 2 years ago .markdownlint.json added az-900 2 years ago LICENSE changed license to \"CC BY-NC 4.0\" 2 years ago README.md Improve logs and monitoring 5 months ago package-lock.json Update dependencies to latest 9 months ago package.json Update dependencies to latest 9 months ago README.md Azure in bulletpoints This repo contains my study notes for different Azure exams.

What is AWS? AWS services are designed in such a way that they work with each other and produce a scalable and efficient outcome. AWS offering services are categorized into 3 types such as Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS). AWS was launched in 2006 and become the best cloud platform among currently available cloud platforms. Cloud platforms offer various advantages such as management overhead reduction, cost minimization, etc. What is AZURE? Microsoft Azure was launched in 2010 and it emerges as one of the biggest commercial cloud service providers. It offers a wide range of integrated cloud services and functionalities such as analytics, computing, networking, database, storage, mobile and web applications that seamlessly integrate with your environment in order to achieve efficiency and scalability. Head to Head Comparison Between AWS and AZURE (Infographics) Below Is The Top 6 Comparison Between AWS vs AZURE Key Differences Between AWS and Azure Both are popular choices in the market; let us discuss some of the major differences: AWS EC2 users can configure their own VMS or pre-configured images whereas Azure users need to choose the virtual hard disk to create a VM which is pre-configured by the third party and need to specify the number of cores and memory required.

Since recently, all reports that are available in the (new) Intune reporting infrastructure are available for export. That export can be achieved from a single top-level export API. Simply use Microsoft Graph API to make the required HTTP call(s). The result of the HTTP call(s) will be a downloadable ZIP-file that contains a CSV-file. That CSV-file contains an export of the latest real-time information and can be imported in EXCEL for some simple data analyses, or in Power BI for more advanced data analyses and visualizations. In this post I\u2019ll show how to use Microsoft Graph to export Intune reports and I\u2019ll show the results of the export. Export Intune reports Let\u2019s start with the easiest part, which is knowing the correct Microsoft Graph API endpoint. That\u2019s the endpoint below. https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/reports/exportJobs The more challenging part is the parameters that can be submitted in the request body. Basically there are the following three main parameters that can be submitted in the request body to define the export request: reportName: This is a required parameter (type String) that contains the name of the report that should be exported. filter: This is an optional parameter, for most reports, (type String) that can be used to filter the dataset. select: This is an optional parameter (type String collection) that can be used to select specific columns of the dataset. When nothing is specified, a default set of columns, which for most reports is the entire dataset, is selected. Note: The documentation about exporting reports provides information about the available reports, the name of the reports, the information that can be used to filter the data and the properties that can be used to select specific columns of the data. Now when making the request, the reportName parameter must be provided as part of the request body. That parameter contains the name of the report that should be exported. Below is an example of an export request for the Devices report that filters on specific data and only selects specific columns. That example can be used in a HTTP POST method on the request.

For example, below is the Az PowerShell command to export all resources details. Search-AzGraph-Query \"Resources\"-first 1000| epcsv .\\testgraph.csv -NoType Note that, by default this procedure returns only 100 records but it can return maximum up to 5000 records so with the help of -First parameter you may explicitly mention the number of records that you wanted to return. Along with it, you may come up with code snippet to send the output to required destination (say database) and schedule it to run on daily basis by saving the complete code as script in a Azure Automation runbook or Azure Logic App, etc. On the other hand as shown in below screenshot, portal way provides options to download the csv and pin to dashboard but not an option to export data to external sources like PowerBI, EventHub, DB, etc. so if interested, you may raise a feature request for it here. In general, Azure feature or product team would check feasibility of a feature request, prioritize against existing feature backlog, add in roadmap as appropriate and would announce and/or update the related Azure document once a feature request is addressed. image.png (77.2 KiB) 0 SPK545-5672 answered \u2022 Dec 09 2020 at 7:58 AM Thanks, @tbgangav-MSFT, In fact, I'm trying to use a graphical runbook (don't know much about Powershell) to\n[4]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/manage-filter-resource-views --- Title: View and filter Azure resource information - Azure portal --- Body: View and filter Azure resource information - Azure portal | Microsoft Docs Azure Azure portal documentation View and filter Azure resource information Article 03/21/2021 2 minutes to read 2 contributors In this article Filter resources Save, use, and delete views Export information from a view Summarize resources with visuals Run queries in Azure Resource Graph Next steps The Azure portal enables you to browse detailed information about resources across your Azure subscriptions. This article shows you how to filter information and use different views to better understand your resources. The article focuses on the All resources screen shown in the following screenshot. Screens for individual resource types, such as virtual machines, have different options, such as starting and stopping a VM. Filter resources Start exploring All resources by using filters to focus on a subset of your resources. The following screenshot shows filtering on resource groups, selecting two of the six resource groups in a subscription. You can combine filters, including those based on text searches, as shown in the following screenshot. In this case the results are scoped to resources that contain \"SimpleWinVM\" in one of the two resource groups already selected. To change which columns are included in a view, select Manage view then Edit columns. Save, use, and delete views You can save views that include the filters and columns you've selected. To save and use a view: Select Manage view then Save view. Enter a name for the view then select OK. The saved view now appears in the Manage view menu.

To keep the active directory running smooth and without issues, one of the tasks is to remove the stale users and devices from the Azure directory or on-premises active directory. In this article, we will see, how we can find a list of stale users and devices in the azure active directory. Stale Devices in Azure Active Directory You need to connect to Azure Active Directory using PowerShell. Open PowerShell with administrative rights and run the following commands. Install-Module -Name AzureAD Install-Module msonline Import-Module -Name AzureAD Import-Module msonline Connect-MsolService You will be prompted for credentials. Provide and you will be connected. Once you are connected, you can run the following command to export the list of Azure stale devices in CSV format. You will find the date column and you can sort that to see which devices are not logged. Get-MsolDevice -all | select-object -Property Enabled, DeviceId, DisplayName, DeviceTrustType, ApproximateLastLogonTimestamp | export-csv \u201cC:\\temp\\az-devices.csv\u201d You can also automate this process by setting up in Azure AD by following steps. Login https://azure.portal.com Search Intune and open Intune blade Select Devices from the left menu Select Device cleanup rules Turn on \u201c Delete devices based on last check-in date\u201d Set number of days, so the device will be removed automatically if not checked in for this many days. Stale Users / Accounts in Azure Active Directory Finding stale users\u2019 accounts is not as easy azure devices, the reason is that there is no attribute like \u201cApproximateLastLogonTimestamp\u201d, however, Microsoft provides a way to get the lastSignInDateTime property using Microsoft Graph and this is still in Beta. I found a very handy PowerShell script and setup graph permission.

It provides a unified way to access data and perform operations on Microsoft 365 resources, making it easier for developers to build applications that integrate with Microsoft services.\n\nUsing Microsoft Graph API, you can authenticate and authorize your application to access specific Microsoft 365 resources on behalf of a user or an organization. You can then use HTTP requests to interact with the resources and retrieve or manipulate data. In the context of exporting CSV files, Microsoft Graph API provides the necessary endpoints and methods to export Intune reports and retrieve the exported files in CSV format.\n\nBy leveraging Microsoft Graph API, you can automate tasks, retrieve data, create, modify, or delete resources, and perform various operations across multiple Microsoft 365 services, all from a single API endpoint.\n\nI hope this clarifies the concept of Microsoft Graph API.

Register your application: Go to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com) and sign in with your Azure account. Navigate to the Azure Active Directory (AAD) service and register a new application. This will give you the necessary credentials (client ID and client secret) to authenticate your application with Microsoft Graph API.\n\n2. Grant necessary permissions: Once your application is registered, you need to configure the required permissions for it to access the desired Microsoft 365 resources. In the Azure portal, go to the \"API permissions\" section of your application registration and grant the necessary permissions based on the operations you want to perform. For example, if you want to export Intune reports, you need to grant permissions related to Intune API.\n\n3. Authenticate your application: Microsoft Graph API supports various authentication methods, such as OAuth 2.0, client credentials flow, or authorization codes. You need to choose the appropriate authentication method based on your application's requirements. Refer to the Microsoft Graph documentation for the specific authentication flow you want to implement.\n\n4. Make API requests: Once your application is authenticated, you can make HTTP requests to Microsoft Graph API endpoints using the appropriate HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). These requests will allow you to interact with the desired Microsoft 365 resources, export Intune reports, and retrieve the exported files in CSV format.\n\nIt's important to note that connecting your system to Microsoft Graph API requires knowledge of programming languages and frameworks, as you will need to write code to handle the authentication and API requests. Microsoft provides SDKs and libraries for various programming languages (such as .NET, Python, and JavaScript) to make it easier to work with Microsoft Graph API.\n\nI recommend referring to the official Microsoft Graph documentation for detailed instructions and code samples on how to connect and interact with Microsoft Graph API in your specific programming language and environment.\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Give code to connect Microsoft Graph API "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly!

(The pyodbc module requires the unixodbc package on Unix, Linux, and macOS.) Download the Databricks ODBC driver. To install the Databricks ODBC driver, open the SimbaSparkODBC.zip file that you downloaded. Do one of the following: macOS: Double-click the extracted Simba Spark.dmg file. Then double-click the SimbaSparkODBC.pkg file that displays, and follow any on-screen directions. Linux: Use your distribution\u2019s package manager utility to install the extracted simbaspark.rpm or simbaspark.deb file, and follow any on-screen directions. Install the unixodbc package: from the terminal, run brew install unixodbc. For more information, see unixodbc on the Homebrew website. Install the pyodbc module: from the terminal, run pip install pyodbc. For more information, see pyodbc on the PyPI website and Install in the pyodbc Wiki. Step 2: Configure software Specify connection details for the an Azure Databricks cluster and SQL endpoint for pyodbc to use. Add the following content to the /etc/odbc.ini file on your machine:\n[2]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/kb/libraries/install-pyodbc-on-cluster --- Title: Error when installing pyodbc on a cluster - Azure ... --- Body: Error when installing pyodbc on a cluster - Azure Databricks | Microsoft Docs Azure Azure Databricks Error when installing pyodbc on a cluster Article 03/11/2022 2 minutes to read 3 contributors In this article Problem Cause Solution Problem One of the following errors occurs when you use pip to install the pyodbc library. Console Copy java.lang.RuntimeException: Installation failed with message: Collecting pyodbc Console Copy \"Library installation is failing due to missing dependencies. sasl and thrift_sasl are optional dependencies for SASL or Kerberos support\" Cause Although sasl and thrift_sasl are optional dependencies for SASL or Kerberos support, they need to be present for pyodbc installation to succeed. Solution Set up solution in a single notebook In the notebook, check the version of thrift and upgrade to the latest version. Bash Copy %sh pip list | egrep 'thrift-sasl|sasl'pip install --upgrade thrift Ensure that dependent packages are installed. Bash Copy %sh dpkg -l | egrep 'thrift_sasl|libsasl2-dev|gcc|python-dev' Install nnixodbc before installing pyodbc. Bash Copy %sh sudo apt-get -y install unixodbc-dev libsasl2-dev gcc python-dev Set up solution as a cluster-scoped init script You can put these commands into a single init script and attach it to the cluster. This ensures that the dependent libraries for pyodbc are installed before the cluster starts. Create the base directory to store the init script in, if the base directory does not exist. Here, use dbfs:/databricks/<directory> as an example. Bash Copy dbutils.fs.mkdirs( \"dbfs:/databricks/<directory>/\") Create the script and save it to a file. Bash Copy dbutils.fs.put( \"dbfs:/databricks/<directory>/tornado.sh\",\"\" \" #!/bin/bash pip list | egrep 'thrift-sasl|sasl' pip install --upgrade thrift dpkg -l | egrep 'thrift_sasl|libsasl2-dev|gcc|python-dev' sudo apt-get -y install unixodbc-dev libsasl2-dev gcc python-dev \" \"\",True) Check that the script exists. Python Copy display(dbutils.fs.ls( \"dbfs:/databricks/<directory>/tornado.sh\")) On the cluster configuration page, click the Advanced Options toggle. At the bottom of the page, click the Init Scripts tab. In the Destination drop-down, select DBFS, provide the file path to the script, and click Add.

Once you establish the connection, you can access the data in Azure Databricks from the Excel, Python, or R clients. You can also use the clients to further analyze the data. Prerequisites You must have an Azure Databricks workspace, a Spark cluster, and sample data associated with your cluster. If you do not already have these prerequisites, complete the quickstart at Run a Spark job on Azure Databricks using the Azure portal. Download the Databricks ODBC driver from Databricks driver download page. Install the 32-bit or 64-bit version depending on the application from where you want to connect to Azure Databricks. For example, to connect from Excel, install the 32-bit version of the driver. To connect from R and Python, install the 64-bit version of the driver. Set up a personal access token in Databricks. For instructions, see Token management. Set up a DSN A data source name (DSN) contains the information about a specific data source. An ODBC driver needs this DSN to connect to a data source. In this section, you set up a DSN that can be used with the Databricks ODBC driver to connect to Azure Databricks from clients like Microsoft Excel, Python, or R. From the Azure Databricks workspace, navigate to the Databricks cluster. Under the Configuration tab, click the JDBC/ODBC tab and copy the values for Server Hostname and HTTP Path. You need these values to complete the steps in this article. On your computer, start ODBC Data Sources application (32-bit or 64-bit) depending on the application. To connect from Excel, use the 32-bit version. To connect from R and Python, use the 64-bit version. Under the User DSN tab, click Add. In the Create New Data Source dialog box, select the Simba Spark ODBC Driver, and then click Finish.

These credentials are not the same as your Azure subscription credentials. User-level credentials: one set of credentials for the entire Azure account. It can be used to deploy to App Service for any app, in any subscription, that the Azure account has permission to access. It's the default set that's surfaced in the portal GUI (such as the Overview and Properties of the app's resource page ). When a user is granted app access via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or coadmin permissions, that user can use their own user-level credentials until the access is revoked. Do not share these credentials with other Azure users. App-level credentials: one set of credentials for each app. It can be used to deploy to that app only. The credentials for each app are generated automatically at app creation. They can't be configured manually, but can be reset anytime. For a user to be granted access to app-level credentials via (RBAC), that user must be contributor or higher on the app (including Website Contributor built-in role). Readers are not allowed to publish, and can't access those credentials.

Deploy files to Azure From your FTP client (for example, Visual Studio, Cyberduck, or WinSCP ), use the connection information you gathered to connect to your app. Copy your files and their respective directory structure to the /site/wwwroot directory in Azure (or the /site/wwwroot/App_Data/Jobs/ directory for WebJobs). Browse to your app's URL to verify the app is running properly. Note Unlike Git-based deployments and Zip deployment, FTP deployment doesn't support build automation, such as: dependency restores (such as NuGet, NPM, PIP, and Composer automations) compilation of .NET binaries generation of web.config (here is a Node.js example) Generate these necessary files manually on your local machine, and then deploy them together with your app. Enforce FTPS For enhanced security, you should allow FTP over TLS/SSL only.

Let me provide you with a detailed comparison of the pricing for Azure SQL Server and PostgreSQL.\n\nAzure SQL Server is a fully managed relational database service provided by Microsoft, while PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system. Both options have different pricing structures.\n\nFor Azure SQL Server, the pricing depends on various factors such as the service tier, compute size, storage size, and region. The service tiers are Basic, Standard, Premium, and General Purpose. Each tier offers different performance and storage capabilities. The compute size determines the processing power and memory available for your database. The storage size refers to the amount of data you can store, and the region affects the cost based on the data center location.\n\nOn the other hand, PostgreSQL in Azure is available as a managed service called Azure Database for PostgreSQL. The pricing for this service is also based on service tiers, compute size, storage size, and region. The service tiers for Azure Database for PostgreSQL are Basic, General Purpose, and Memory Optimized. Each tier offers different performance and storage capabilities. The compute size and storage size options are similar to Azure SQL Server. The region also affects the cost based on the data center location.\n\nIt's important to note that the actual pricing for both Azure SQL Server and Azure Database for PostgreSQL may vary based on your specific requirements and usage patterns. I recommend visiting the Microsoft Azure website or contacting Azure support for the most up-to-date and accurate pricing information.\n\nI hope this comparison helps you understand the pricing differences between Azure SQL Server and PostgreSQL.

This means that Microsoft handles most of the administrative tasks such as backups, maintenance, and patching, allowing you to focus more on your application development. On the other hand, PostgreSQL is an open-source database system that requires more manual configuration and management.\n\nAnother difference is the integration with other Azure services. Azure SQL Server is deeply integrated with other Azure services such as Azure Active Directory, Azure Key Vault, and Azure Monitor. This allows for seamless integration and enhanced security and monitoring capabilities. While PostgreSQL can also be used with Azure services, the level of integration may not be as comprehensive as with Azure SQL Server.\n\nAdditionally, Azure SQL Server offers features and capabilities that are specific to the Microsoft SQL Server engine. These include built-in high availability with automatic failover, built-in security features, and compatibility with a wide range of applications and development tools.\n\nPostgreSQL, being an open-source solution, has its own set of advantages. It has a large and active community of developers, which means rapid development, frequent updates, and a wide range of add-ons and extensions. It also has excellent support for JSON and geolocation data types, making it well-suited for certain types of applications.\n\nIn summary, the price difference between Azure SQL Server and PostgreSQL can be justified by the level of managed services, integration with Azure, specific capabilities of the SQL Server engine, and the advantages of an open-source solution in the case of PostgreSQL. It is important to evaluate your specific requirements and consider these differences when making a decision."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you provide me with some best practices to keep in mind before selecting any of these servers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! Here are some best practices to keep in mind before selecting either Azure SQL Server or PostgreSQL:\n\n1. Identify your specific requirements: Understand your application's needs, including performance requirements, storage capacity, scalability, security, and integration with other systems. This will help you choose the most suitable database server for your use case.\n\n2. Consider cost: Evaluate the pricing models and factors for both Azure SQL Server and PostgreSQL to ensure they align with your budget and cost expectations.\n\n3. Evaluate scalability and performance: Determine the scalability options and performance capabilities of each database server. Consider factors such as the maximum number of concurrent connections, throughput, latency, and the ability to handle your anticipated workload.\n\n4. Security and compliance: Review the security features offered by each database server, such as built-in encryption, role-based access control, and compliance certifications. Ensure that the selected server meets your organization's security and compliance requirements.\n\n5. Integration with other services and tools: If you plan to use other Azure services or specific development tools, consider the level of integration and compatibility with the chosen database server. This will help streamline your development and management processes.\n\n6. Support and documentation: Assess the availability of technical support, community forums, and documentation for each database server. Consider the level of support you may need and the resources available to assist with troubleshooting and maintaining the servers.\n\n7. Consider vendor lock-in: Evaluate the potential for vendor lock-in when selecting a database server. Determine if the features and functionality provided by the vendor are unique and critical to your application, or if you can easily switch to another database server in the future, if needed.\n\nBy following these best practices, you can make an informed decision when selecting either Azure SQL Server or PostgreSQL based on your specific requirements and considerations.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks for the information."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You're welcome!

When will this become a supported feature? To me, it is mind-blowing you cannot rename existing resources. If you're trying to standardize existing resources, it becomes impossible to adopt a universal naming convention. To an extent, this makes sense. In many cases, the object name becomes a DNS name and is referenced in the object's resource ID. What doesn't make sense is why the Azure engineers chose the resource name to be the unique identifier (primary key). How did it pass review? Create a UUID instead! Reference only the UUID in the resource ID. Whenever someone chooses to rename an existing object, check whether the DNS name is reserved, just as with the initial provisioning. Judging from this post, it is not an uncommon request, but frustrating that Microsoft painted themselves into a corner with this.

Instead, you would need to create a new resource with the desired name and then migrate or deploy your data or configurations to the new resource [[4]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59772456/which-resources-in-azure-can-i-change-the-names-of-and-it-will-not-break-anythin).\n\nIt's important to note that changes to resource names may have implications and could require adjustments to dependencies, configurations, or references in your applications or deployments. Therefore, it is recommended to plan and test these changes thoroughly before implementing them in a production environment.\n\nPlease let me know if you need more information or if there's anything else I can assist you with!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Give an example of how one can rename azure resources"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Let's consider an example of renaming an Azure virtual machine.\n\n1. Create a new virtual machine with the desired name: Start by creating a new virtual machine with the desired name using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell. Make sure to set up the new virtual machine with the necessary configurations and settings.\n\n2. Migrate or deploy your data and configurations: Once the new virtual machine is created, you will need to migrate or deploy your data, configurations, and any dependencies from the old virtual machine to the new one. This can involve transferring files, databases, or any other relevant data.\n\n3. Verify and test: After moving the necessary data and configurations, verify that everything is working correctly on the new virtual machine. Test your applications or services to ensure they function as expected.\n\n4. Decommission the old virtual machine: Once you have confirmed that the new virtual machine is functioning properly, you can decommission and delete the old virtual machine. This step ensures that you are no longer using resources or incurring unnecessary costs for the old virtual machine.\n\nIt's important to note that this process might vary depending on the specific resource you are renaming.

Here are a few common approaches:\n\n1. Data migration tools: Azure provides tools like Azure Data Factory, Azure Database Migration Service, and Azure Site Recovery that can help you migrate data between different Azure resources. These tools offer automated and guided workflows for transferring data and can handle different data sources and destinations.\n\n2. Azure Storage: If you are migrating or deploying files or data stored in Azure Storage, you can use tools like AzCopy or Azure Storage Explorer to copy the data between storage accounts. These tools allow you to transfer files or blobs with ease.\n\n3. Database migration: If you are migrating databases, the specific method will depend on the database type. For example, Azure Database Migration Service can be used to migrate on-premises databases to Azure SQL Database or Azure Managed Instance. Similarly, there are migration tools available for migrating MySQL, PostgreSQL, and other database types.\n\n4. Custom scripts or scripts provided by the service: Some services, such as Azure App Service, provide deployment options that allow you to deploy your applications using custom scripts or predefined deployment scripts. These scripts can handle copying your application code, configurations, and dependencies to the new resource.\n\n5. Export and import: In some cases, you can export data from the existing resource and then import it into the new resource. For example, if you want to migrate data from one Azure SQL Database to another, you can use the export and import functionality provided by Azure SQL Database.\n\nRemember to plan and test your migration or deployment process to ensure data integrity and minimal disruption to your applications or services.

Some of the types of data that can be exported from Azure SQL Database are:\n\n1. Tables: You can export individual tables or multiple tables from an Azure SQL Database. This allows you to export specific data or subsets of data within your database.\n\n2. Views: If you have views defined in your Azure SQL Database, you can export them along with the associated data. Views can be a convenient way to export pre-defined result sets from your database.\n\n3. Stored Procedures: Azure SQL Database allows you to export stored procedures as part of the data export process. You can export individual stored procedures or all stored procedures present in the database.\n\n4. Functions: If you have user-defined functions in your Azure SQL Database, you can include them in the data export. This ensures that the exported data is accompanied by the necessary functions for manipulating or processing the data.\n\n5. Triggers: Triggers defined in your Azure SQL Database can also be exported. Triggers are used to enforce business rules or perform specific actions when certain events occur in the database.\n\n6. Data-tier Applications: Azure SQL Database supports exporting the entire database as a data-tier application (DACPAC). This includes all the schema, objects, and data within the database, allowing you to re-create the database in another environment or Azure subscription.\n\nWhen exporting data from Azure SQL Database, you have the option to export it as a BACPAC file, which is a binary file that contains the database schema and data, or as a DACPAC file, which contains only the schema. These files can be used for various purposes, such as creating backups, migrating data, or deploying the database to a different environment.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific options and capabilities for data export may vary based on the version of Azure SQL Database and the tools you are using.

Use a factory public class OrderService { private readonly IPaymentGatewayFactory _factory; public void DoOrder(bool isFoo) { IPaymentGateway service = _factory.Create(isFoo); this._service.Pay(); } } Where the factory can be: public class PaymentGatewayFactory : IPaymentGatewayFactory { public PaymentGatewayFactory(PaymentGatewayFoo foo, PaymentGatewayBoo boo) {...} public IPaymentGateway Create(bool isFoo) => isFoo ? this.foo : this.boo; } Pros and cons: Downside of using a factory is that the consumer needs to be aware of two abstractions: the factory and the IPaymentGateway. 2. Use an adapter public class OrderService { private readonly IPayment _payment; public void DoOrder(bool isFoo) { _payment.Pay(isFoo); } } Where the adapter can be: public class PaymentAdapter : IPayment { public PaymentAdapter(PaymentGatewayFoo foo, PaymentGatewayBoo boo) {...} public void Pay(bool isFoo) { var service = isFoo ? this.foo : this.boo; service.Pay(); } } Pros and cons:\n[2]: URL: https://hamidmosalla.com/2018/06/30/dependency-injection-conditional-resolving-of-multiple-implementation-of-interface --- Title: \ue000Dependency\ue001 Injection: \ue000Conditional\ue001 Resolving Of Multiple ... --- Body: Dependency Injection: Conditional Resolving Of Multiple Implementation of Interface June 30, 2018 by Hamid Mosalla | .Net, Asp.Net Core, C# in Conditional Resolving, Dependency Injection, DI, Multiple Implementation Dependency Injection: Conditional Resolving of Multiple Implementation of Interface Sometimes we need to resolve a dependency but not with one implementation, but with multiple. There are couple of scenarios that calls for conditional resolving of types. Such as when using a generic class and methods with a dependency on another class. Now imagine the aforementioned class is an abstract one, and we need to pass various concrete implementations. Another scenario is when we need to get an instance for an interface or abstract class, but we need to do it based on some criteria. As of the time of this writing, the built-in Asp.Net Core DI does not accommodate that. So in this post I\u2019m going to explain what my problem was and how I solved it. We\u2019re also going to see how to solve the problem we need to resolve dependency based on conditions. Problem: Multiple Implementation For the Same Abstract Type The problem that I\u2019ve encountered with was I had a generic service that worked with multiple context. The details of each context didn\u2019t matter, it was only the generic db context methods that mattered. Let me clarify by showing you an example. public class HttpRequestServiceNonEntity: IHttpRequestServiceNonEntity { private readonly IUrlHelper _urlHelper; private readonly IActionContextAccessor _contextAccessor; private readonly DbContext _context; private readonly IAdapter _mapper; public HttpRequestServiceNonEntity(IUrlHelper urlHelper, IActionContextAccessor contextAccessor, DbContext context, IAdapter mapper) { _urlHelper=urlHelper; _contextAccessor=contextAccessor; _context=context; _mapper=mapper; } public async Task<IActionResult> GetRequest<TEntity, TDto, TKey >( TKey id) where TEntity : class where TDto : DtoNonEntityBase<TKey> { if (id.IsNullOrEmpty ()) return new BadRequestResult (); var dbSet=_context.Set<TEntity >(); var entityName=await dbSet.FindAsync(id ); if (entityName == null) return new NotFoundResult (); var entityDto=_mapper.Adapt<TDto >( entityName ); entityDto.Links=CreateLinksForEntity(id, typeof(TEntity ). Name ); return new OkObjectResult(entityDto ); } } view raw HttpRequestServiceNonEntity.cs hosted with by GitHub As you can see, this class has a dependency on DbContext and uses it as you can see in GetRequest method. Now the problem is I want to use this method with multiple db context and not just one. Imagine in one controller I want to use this with SchoolDbContext in another controller I want to use it with HomeDbContext. So now what should I register in my DI container? Maybe something like this? Services.AddScoped<DbContext, SchoolDbContext>(); Services.AddScoped<DbContext, HomeDbContext\n[3]: URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45666232/conditional-dependency-resolving-in-asp-net-core --- Title: c# - Conditional Dependency Resolving in Asp.net core ... --- Body: c# - Conditional Dependency Resolving in Asp.net core - Stack Overflow Conditional Dependency Resolving in Asp.net core Ask Question 4 I am having a 2 controller PayerController and BusinessController.

They can get confusing quickly, you need one syntax in one place and another elsewhere. So, here are a few things I have learnt\u2026 What are stage dependency variables? Stage Dependencies are the way you define which stage follows another in a multi-stage YAML pipeline. This is as opposed to just relying on the order they appear in the YAML file, the default order. Hence, they are critical to creating complex pipelines. Stage Dependency variables are the way you can pass variables from one stage to another. Special handling is required, as you can\u2019t just use the ordinary output variables (which are in effect environment variables on the agent) as you might within a job as there is no guarantee the stages and jobs are running on the same agent. For stage dependency variables, is not how you create output variables, that does not differ from the standard manner, the difference is in how you retrieve them. In my sample, I used a BASH script to set the output variable based on a parameter passed into the pipeline, but you can create output variables using scripts or tasks - stage: SetupStage displayName: 'Setup Stage' jobs: - job: SetupJob displayName: 'Setup Job' steps: - checkout: none - bash: | set -e # need to avoid trailing \" being added to the variable https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/issues/10331 echo \"##vso[task.setvariable variable=MyVar;isOutput=true]${{parameters.value}}\" name: SetupStep displayName: 'Setup Step' Possible ways to access a stage dependency variable There are two basic ways to access stage dependency variables, both using array objects stageDependencies.STAGENAME.JOBNAME.outputs['STEPNAME.VARNAME'] dependencies.STAGENAME.outputs['JOBNAME.STEPNAME.VARNAME'] Which one you use, in which place, and whether via a local alias is the complexity How to access a stage dependency in a script? To access a stage dependency variable in a script, or a task, there are two key requirements The stage containing the consuming job and hence script/task, must be set as dependant on the stage that created the output variable You have to declare a local alias for the value in the stageDependencies array within the consuming stage. This local alias will be used as the local name\n[5]: URL: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-intune/how-to-exclude-teams-from-conditional-access/td-p/1879092 --- Title: How to exclude Teams from conditional access - Microsoft ... --- Body: How to exclude Teams from conditional access - Microsoft Tech Community Tech Community Live: Endpoint Manager edition Jul 21 2022, 08:00 AM - 12:00 PM (PDT) Home Microsoft Endpoint Manager Microsoft Intune How to exclude Teams from conditional access Skip to Topic Message How to exclude Teams from conditional access Discussion Options Arthur_wang Contributor \u200eNov 11 2020 06:39 PM How to exclude Teams from conditional access I want to only allow users to use Teams and Outlook apps on their smartphones.

It acts as a bridge between the on-premises environment and Azure Active Directory, securely transmitting user and device information from your on-premises systems to Azure AD for evaluation.\n\nHere's how the Azure AD Conditional Access Connector works:\n1. Installation and configuration: You need to install the Azure AD Conditional Access Connector on a server in your on-premises environment. During the installation, you will associate the connector with your Azure AD tenant.\n2. Communication with Azure AD: Once installed, the Azure AD Conditional Access Connector establishes a secure and encrypted connection with Azure AD using outbound communication over port 443 (HTTPS). This ensures that the transmitted data is protected.\n3. User and device information: The connector collects user and device information from your on-premises systems, such as Active Directory, Exchange Server, or other applications and services. This information includes user identities, device compliance status, and other relevant attributes.\n4. Evaluation of Conditional Access policies: The connector sends the collected user and device information to Azure AD for evaluation against the configured Conditional Access policies. Azure AD determines which policies apply to the user and device and whether additional authentication or access restrictions are required.\n5. Policy enforcement: Based on the evaluation results, Azure AD instructs the connector on how to enforce the Conditional Access policies in your on-premises environment. This can include actions such as requiring multi-factor authentication, blocking access, or allowing access with specific conditions.\n6. Reporting and logging: The connector logs the enforcement decisions and events, providing visibility and audit trails for compliance and troubleshooting purposes.\n\nThe Azure AD Conditional Access Connector enables you to extend the benefits of Conditional Access policies to your on-premises applications and services, allowing you to enforce consistent security policies across your hybrid environment. It helps protect your organization's resources by ensuring that access is granted based on the user's context and compliance with security requirements.\n\nNote that the Azure AD Conditional Access Connector is different from the Azure AD Connect tool, which is used for synchronizing user identities between on-premises Active Directory and Azure AD. The Conditional Access Connector focuses specifically on integrating on-premises applications and services with Conditional Access policies."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Explain the Cloud App Security in detail ?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Azure Cloud App Security is a comprehensive cloud-native security solution that provides visibility, control, and threat protection for your cloud applications and services.

Each of these has their own story on how they provide encryption for data at rest and in transit. In this article, learn about each one and which is best for your scenario. Important For production grade encryption during training, Microsoft recommends using Azure Machine Learning compute cluster. For production grade encryption during inference, Microsoft recommends using Azure Kubernetes Service. Azure Machine Learning compute instance is a dev/test environment. When using it, we recommend that you store your files, such as notebooks and scripts, in a file share. Your data should be stored in a datastore. Encryption at rest Azure Machine Learning relies on multiple Azure Services, each of which have their own encryption capabilities. Azure Blob storage Azure Machine Learning stores snapshots, output, and logs in the Azure Blob storage account (default storage account) that's tied to the Azure Machine Learning workspace and your subscription. All the data stored in Azure Blob storage is encrypted at rest with Microsoft-managed keys. For information on how to use your own keys for data stored in Azure Blob storage, see Azure Storage encryption with customer-managed keys in Azure Key Vault. Training data is typically also stored in Azure Blob storage so that it's accessible to training compute targets. This storage isn't managed by Azure Machine Learning but mounted to compute targets as a remote file system. If you need to rotate or revoke your key, you can do so at any time. When rotating a key, the storage account will start using the new key (latest version) to encrypt data at rest. When revoking (disabling) a key, the storage account takes care of failing requests. It usually takes an hour for the rotation or revocation to be effective. For information on regenerating the access keys, see Regenerate storage access keys. Azure Cosmos DB Azure Machine Learning stores metadata in an Azure Cosmos DB instance. This instance is associated with a Microsoft subscription managed by Azure Machine Learning.

I\u2019ve been fortunate to have worked with clients who passed on application forms they\u2019ve received when obtaining cyber & data breach insurance and found that every iteration dives deeper into how well their data is protected. This has lead to many conversations around explaining to technical and non-technical audiences about how Azure protects their data. I have to admit that I\u2019m not an encryption expert but have made a conscious effort to keep up with the technologies available to be a better solutions architect so this post serves to provide an overview of the various options of how data can be encrypted in Azure. Two of the types of encryption you\u2019ll see most while searching through Azure documentation will be: Server-side Encryption (SSE) Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) For the purpose of narrowing the scope, I will discuss how these apply to IaaS virtual machines in Azure and leave Storage Accounts in another post for the future. Due to the amount of content required for SSE and ADE, this post will be separated into two parts. Server-side Encryption (SSE) \u2013 Part #1 Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) \u2013 Part #2 Let me begin by providing the following links to the documentation provided by Microsoft: Server-side encryption of Azure Disk Storage https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disk-encryption Azure Data Encryption at rest https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-atrest Use the Azure portal to enable server-side encryption with customer-managed keys for managed disks https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-enable-customer-managed-keys-portal What is encryption at rest? https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-atrest#what-is-encryption-at-rest Azure Storage encryption for data at rest https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption Preview: Server-side encryption with customer-managed keys for Azure Managed Disks https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/blog/preview-server-side-encryption-with-customer-managed-keys-for-azure-managed-disks/ Data encryption models https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-models I\u2019ve found all of the documentation very information and highly suggest the read but it is also a bit difficult to tie all of the information together and impractical to send these to a client so the following is usually how I present the information either through a PowerPoint or discussion with Visio diagrams.

These definitions are shared across all resource providers in Azure to ensure common language and taxonomy. There are three scenarios for server-side encryption: Server-side encryption using Service-Managed keys Azure Resource Providers perform the encryption and decryption operations Microsoft manages the keys Full cloud functionality Server-side encryption using customer-managed keys in Azure Key Vault Azure Resource Providers perform the encryption and decryption operations Customer controls keys via Azure Key Vault Full cloud functionality Server-side encryption using customer-managed keys on customer-controlled hardware Azure Resource Providers perform the encryption and decryption operations Customer controls keys on customer-controlled hardware Full cloud functionality Server-side Encryption models refer to encryption that is performed by the Azure service. In that model, the Resource Provider performs the encrypt and decrypt operations. For example, Azure Storage may receive data in plain text operations and will perform the encryption and decryption internally. The Resource Provider might use encryption keys that are managed by Microsoft or by the customer depending on the provided configuration. Each of the server-side encryption at rest models implies distinctive characteristics of key management. This includes where and how encryption keys are created, and stored as well as the access models and the key rotation procedures. For client-side encryption, consider the following: Azure services cannot see decrypted data Customers manage and store keys on-premises (or in other secure stores). Keys are not available to Azure services Reduced cloud functionality The supported encryption models in Azure split into two main groups: \"Client Encryption\" and \"Server-side Encryption\" as mentioned previously. Independent of the encryption at rest model used, Azure services always recommend the use of a secure transport such as TLS or HTTPS. Therefore, encryption in transport should be addressed by the transport protocol and should not be a major factor in determining which encryption at rest model to use. Client encryption model Client Encryption model refers to encryption that is performed outside of the Resource Provider\n[4]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/office-365-service-encryption --- Title: Service Encryption - Microsoft 365 Compliance | Microsoft Docs --- Body: Service encryption - Microsoft Purview (compliance) | Microsoft Docs Docs Manage information protection Encryption Service Encryption Article 07/05/2022 2 minutes to read 12 contributors In this article Microsoft-managed keys Customer Key In addition to using volume-level encryption, Exchange Online, Microsoft Teams, SharePoint Online, and OneDrive for Business also use Service Encryption to encrypt customer data. Service Encryption allows for two key management options: Microsoft-managed keys Microsoft manages all cryptographic keys including the root keys for service encryption. This option is currently enabled by default for Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business. Microsoft-managed keys provide default service encryption unless you decide to onboard using Customer Key. If, at a later date, you decide to stop using Customer Key without following the data purge path, then your data stays encrypted using the Microsoft-managed keys. Your data is always encrypted at this default level at a minimum. Customer Key You supply root keys used with service encryption and you manage these keys using Azure Key Vault. Microsoft manages all other keys. This option is called Customer Key, and it is currently available for Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and OneDrive for Business. (Previously referred to as Advanced Encryption with BYOK. See Enhancing transparency and control for Office 365 customers for the original announcement.) Service encryption provides multiple benefits: Provides an added layer of protection on top of BitLocker. Provides separation of Windows operating system administrators from access to application data stored or processed by the operating system. Includes a Customer Key option that enables multi-tenant services to provide per-tenant key management. Enhances the ability of Microsoft 365 to meet the demands of customers that have specific compliance requirements regarding encryption. Using Customer Key, you can generate your own cryptographic keys using either an on-premises Hardware Service Module (HSM) or Azure Key Vault (AKV). Regardless of how you generate the key, you use AKV to control and manage the cryptographic keys used by Office 365. Once your keys are stored in AKV, they can be used as the root of one of the keychains that encrypts your mailbox data or files. Another benefit of Customer Key is the control you have over the ability of Microsoft to process your data. If you want to remove data from Office 365, such as if you want to terminate service with Microsoft or remove a portion of your data stored in the cloud, you can do so\n[5]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-atrest --- Title: Azure Data Encryption-at-Rest - Azure Security | Microsoft ... --- Body: Azure Data Encryption-at-Rest - Azure Security | Microsoft Docs Azure Security Fundamentals Azure Data Encryption at rest Article 01/02/2022 11 minutes to read 20 contributors In this article What is encryption at rest? The purpose of encryption at rest Azure Encryption at Rest Components Encryption at rest in Microsoft cloud services Azure resource providers encryption model support Conclusion Next steps Microsoft Azure includes tools to safeguard data according to your company's security and compliance needs. This paper focuses on: How data is protected at rest across Microsoft Azure Discusses the various components taking part in the data protection implementation, Reviews pros and cons of the different key management protection approaches. Encryption at Rest is a common security requirement. In Azure, organizations can encrypt data at rest without the risk or cost of a custom key management solution. Organizations have the option of letting Azure completely manage Encryption at Rest. Additionally, organizations have various options to closely manage encryption or encryption keys. What is encryption at rest? Encryption is the secure encoding of data used to protect confidentiality of data. The Encryption at Rest designs in Azure use symmetric encryption to encrypt and decrypt large amounts of data quickly according to a simple conceptual model: A symmetric encryption key is used to encrypt data as it is written to storage. The same encryption key is used to decrypt that data as it is readied for use in memory. Data may be partitioned, and different keys may be used for each partition. Keys must be stored in a secure location with identity-based access control and audit policies. Data encryption keys which are stored outside of secure locations are encrypted with a key encryption key kept in a secure location. In practice, key management and control scenarios, as well as scale and availability assurances, require additional constructs. Microsoft Azure Encryption at Rest concepts and components are described below. The purpose of encryption at rest Encryption at rest provides data protection for stored data (at rest). Attacks against data at-rest include attempts to obtain physical access to the hardware on which the data is stored, and then compromise the contained data. In such an attack, a server's hard drive may have been mishandled during maintenance allowing an attacker to remove the hard drive. Later the attacker would put the hard drive into a computer under their control to attempt to access the data. Encryption\n", "messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!

It is a service designed to allow developers to integrate disparate data sources. It is a platform somewhat like SSIS in the cloud to manage the data you have both on-prem and in the cloud. AWS Glue and Azure Data Factory belong to \"Big Data Tools\" category of the tech stack. Some of the features offered by AWS Glue are: Easy - AWS Glue automates much of the effort in building, maintaining, and running ETL jobs. AWS Glue crawls your data sources, identifies data formats, and suggests schemas and transformations. AWS Glue automatically generates the code to execute your data transformations and loading processes. Integrated - AWS Glue is integrated across a wide range of AWS services. Serverless - AWS Glue is serverless. There is no infrastructure to provision or manage. AWS Glue handles provisioning, configuration, and scaling of the resources required to run your ETL jobs on a fully managed, scale-out Apache Spark environment. You pay only for the resources used while your jobs are running. On the other hand, Azure Data Factory provides the following key features: Real-Time Integration Parallel Processing Data Chunker Azure Data Factory is an open source tool with 150 GitHub stars and 255 GitHub forks.

It was me once then and I\u2019ve consolidated my learnings related to Data Lake as a reference. Might as well share with the other enthusiasts and I hope this blog can bring you some familiarity with Data Lake at the end of it and how it looks like on the current day major cloud providers, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Azure. Kinda a lake but not Data Lake This blog will be most useful if you are somewhat familiar with either AWS or Azure and have some exposure in Data Warehousing. If you are new to the Cloud Platforms, you may still want to read on the concepts here. There are some examples described in the blog, however, for a detailed understanding of how each Cloud service works in the diagram, you may ask for Professor Google\u2019s help or consult respective Cloud Provider\u2019s documentation. Building a Data Lake on Cloud becomes slightly easier as all the cloud providers have extensive documentation on how to build them. So, you can treat this blog as a baseline summary or comparison for Data Lakes among different Cloud Providers and dive deeper on your own if you are interested in learning more or implementing it. A bit of History Before we dive into Data Lake, let\u2019s review Four Levels of Data which was conceptualized by Bill Inmon \u2014 father of Data Warehouse. On-premise data warehouse system (Diagram from Databricks) Operational, your transactional database which acts as OLTP (Online Transaction Processing). e.g. sales or clicks data. Atomic, your traditional Data Warehouse. Normalized data is stored using dimension modeling which is often a star schema and acts as a Single Source of Truth for Enterprise Decision Support System (EDSS) enabling OLAP (Online Analytical Processing). Also known as \u201c Storage Layer\u201d. This layer stores all the data associated with every transaction. E.g. If an order was modified, all versions of that order will be available in this layer but only the modified version is available in the Operational layer.

In this post, I will get an introduction into cryptographic service provider architecture and how certutil can list and query them. A short introduction to Cryptographic Providers Windows Cryptography relies on a cryptographic service provider (CSP) architecture when performing cryptographic operations. CSP is a program module that represents an abstraction between client application and functions that utilize private keys. Applications are not required to interact with private key material directly, implement cryptographic functions. They only interact with known CSPs that implement private key storage database and cryptographic functions and operations. Here is a simple diagram that shows the relationship between client application and CSP: When certificate is installed into Windows Certificate Store, public certificate is installed in registry and private key is registered and installed in selected CSP. When necessary, application queries the CSP and asks CSP to do the job, say generate key, hash, encrypt or sign data and get results. Application has zero knowledge of what is happening behind. Microsoft Windows can support multiple CSPs and allows developers to write their own CSPs. One common cases of custom providers are hardware key storages like smart cards and hardware security modules (HSM). Custom CSP implements cryptographic algorithms, operations and interaction with key storage on hardware devices. If application needs to access the certificate on a smart card, application just communicates with smart card CSP via unified interface and all the rest is done by CSP. After releasing Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, there is a brand new CSP subsystem called Cryptography Next Generation (CNG). CNG is was written from scratch and is not compatible with legacy CSP subsystem. CNG brings a lot of improvements to CryptoAPI, but the idea is still the same. Also, CNG ships a new class of CSPs called Key Storage Provider or KSP. In general, KSP and CSP are similar in terms of their purpose. CSP refers to legacy CryptoAPI 1.0 and KSP refers to CNG or CAPI2. Microsoft ships a number of different providers with different capabilities. Custom providers may be installed. So, let\u2019s start with basic operations. Enumerate the list of\n", "messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!

The lock duration can be 15 to 60 seconds, or can be infinite. The Lease Container operation can be called in one of five modes: Acquire, to request a new lease. Renew, to renew an existing lease. Change, to change the ID of an existing lease. Release, to free the lease if it is no longer needed so that another client may immediately acquire a lease against the container. Break, to end the lease but ensure that another client cannot acquire a new lease until the current lease period has expired. Note The Lease Container operation is available in version 2012-02-12 and newer. Request The Lease Container request may be constructed as follows. HTTPS is recommended. Replace myaccount with the name of your storage account: Method Request URI HTTP Version PUT https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer?comp=lease&restype=container HTTP/1.1 To specify the root container, enter $root as the container name.

The blades that display the list of containers and list of blobs display the current lease status of each item. On these blades, you can select one or more containers or blobs and acquire leases on them. When you acquire leases on blobs, lease IDs are generated. You can then use these lease IDs for exclusive access to the blobs. Similarly, you can select blobs that already have leases on them and break the leases. Do this with caution, because if a blob is a VHD that\u2019s attached to a virtual machine, breaking the lease will cause the VM to stop functioning correctly. You can verify if this is the case by opening the metadata blade for that blob and viewing if the metadata specifies a VM name.

How do I break a lease on a blob? How do I view and set a container access policy? How do I transfer data from Azure Blob Storage to a database? What is Blob Storage? Azure Blob (binary large object) Storage is Microsoft's cloud object storage solution. An \u2018object\u2019 describes images, text files, audio files, file backups, logs, etc. Azure Blob Storage is optimized for storing very large volumes of unstructured data that isn't constrained to a specific model or schema. Blob Storage is highly convenient and customizable to your needs. Users have many options to store and retrieve data from an instance of Azure Blob Storage. Microsoft maintains client libraries for .Net, Java, Node.js, Python, Go, PHP, and Ruby. Additionally, you can also access objects using HTTP/HTTPS. Another selling point is that you also have security built-in through Microsoft's platform, as well as the additional benefit of high availability and disaster recovery. What is the structure of Blob? Account \u2192 Container \u2192 Blob Blob Storage is relatively intuitive and similar to a traditional file structure: directory>subdirectory>file schema. Each Azure Blob Storage account can contain an unlimited number of containers, and each container can contain an unlimited number of blobs. People often think of the container as the directory in the above example, and try to create folders within the containers to replicate a traditional structure, producing a virtual file structure. However, it is better to think of the container as the subdirectory from above and the account itself as the directory. To avoid unnecessary complications, try to make the files as flat as possible without\n[5]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.specialized.blobleaseclient --- Title: BlobLeaseClient Class (Azure.Storage.Blobs.Specialized) - Azure for ... --- Body: BlobLeaseClient Class (Azure.Storage.Blobs.Specialized) - Azure for .NET Developers | Microsoft Docs Storage Blobs Azure.

Exclusive Access: By acquiring a lease on a storage container, you can ensure that no other client can modify or delete the container. This allows you to have exclusive access to the container for a specified period of time.\n\n2. Consistency: Leasing a container can help maintain consistency in your application. It prevents multiple clients from modifying the container simultaneously, which can lead to conflicts and data inconsistencies.\n\n3. Process Coordination: Leasing can be used to coordinate processes or tasks that require exclusive access to a container. For example, if you have a background job that needs to process the contents of a container, you can acquire a lease to ensure that only one instance of the job is running at a time.\n\n4. Concurrency Control: Leasing can be used for controlling concurrency in distributed systems. By acquiring a lease, you can ensure that only one client at a time has access to the container, reducing the chances of conflicts and race conditions.\n\n5. Data Integrity: Leasing can help ensure data integrity by preventing unauthorized modifications to the container. By acquiring a lease, you can protect the container from accidental deletions or modifications.\n\nOverall, acquiring a lease for a storage container gives you more control and ensures the integrity and consistency of your data."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Got it.

You only pay for it while it\u2019s running, turn it off and save some cash. The VMs with GPUs can be pricey, but I feel like stand alone is going to be cheaper and easier than WVD. 2 level 2 Sighlence92 \u00b7 2 yr. ago With WVD, you only pay for the VM session host, so there would not be any additional cost compared to a stand alone VM. Setup, would of course be a little more difficult, but the WVD blade is in preview now and it's pretty easy to use.

Here's what you can do when you run Azure Virtual Desktop on Azure: Set up a multi-session Windows 11 or Windows 10 deployment that delivers a full Windows experience with scalability Present Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise and optimize it to run in multi-user virtual scenarios Provide Windows 7 virtual desktops with free Extended Security Updates Bring your existing Remote Desktop Services (RDS) and Windows Server desktops and apps to any computer Virtualize both desktops and apps Manage desktops and apps from different Windows and Windows Server operating systems with a unified management experience Introductory video Learn about Azure Virtual Desktop (formerly Windows Virtual Desktop), why it's unique, and what's new in this video: Windows Virtual Desktop Essentials | Intro and full tour Copy link Watch on For more videos about Azure Virtual Desktop, see our playlist. Key capabilities With Azure Virtual Desktop, you can set up a scalable and flexible environment: Create a full desktop virtualization environment in your Azure subscription without running any gateway servers. Publish host pools as you need to accommodate your diverse workloads. Bring your own image for production workloads or test from the Azure Gallery. Reduce costs with pooled, multi-session resources. With the new Windows 11 and Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session capability, exclusive to Azure Virtual Desktop and Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH) role on Windows Server, you can greatly reduce the number of virtual machines and operating system overhead while still providing the same resources to your users. Provide individual ownership through personal (persistent) desktops. Use autoscale to automatically increase or decrease capacity based on time of day, specific days of the week, or as demand changes, helping to manage cost. You can deploy and manage virtual desktops: Use the Azure portal, Azure CLI, PowerShell and REST API to configure the host pools, create app groups, assign users, and publish resources. Publish full desktop or individual remote apps from a single host pool, create individual app groups for different sets of users, or even assign users to multiple app groups to reduce the number of images. As you manage your environment, use built-in delegated access\n[3]: URL: https://reddit.com/r/azure/comments/nudg6s/windows_virtual_desktop_is_now_azure_virtual --- Title: Windows Virtual Desktop is now Azure Virtual Desktop --- Body: Windows Virtual Desktop is now Azure Virtual Desktop : AZURE 104 Posted by u/MisterJohnson87 11 months ago Windows Virtual Desktop is now Azure Virtual Desktop azure.microsoft.com/en-us/...

I have log analytics, dashboards set up to monitor VM resource usage, checked event logs, ran RD diagnostics through Powershell, even checked the user's home internet, and there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason why people get randomly disconnected. I don't really have a direction to go other than to try and update the Remote Desktop client and hope the user stays connected. I would like a find a root cause, but I can't. There's nothing really out there on the web either. Our environment is fairly straightforward: 4 virtual machines running as session hosts. 4vcpus, 16GB of ram reach. Each host is capped at 6 users per machine. Depth first load balancing. All network traffic routed through a cloud WatchGuard firebox. Has any one else experienced this?

It is a quite handy way to create or edit resources and you find it in many examples in the internet, especially on the Microsoft documentation pages. But I had a problem with that long time: saving the created examples proper and a handy way for execution and repeating the tasks. Discovered just a few weeks ago during preparation for a training course, CLI Scrapbooks come for the win\u2026 Writing & Saving CLI code So the usual task, for example on microsoft learn, is something like: Insert a statement in the cloud shell, replacing <mysubscription> with your subscription, same for resource group and so on. So, you copy the statement anywhere, replace the values, copy again, paste it in the cloud shell \u2013 following the tutorial. For repeating you can save the statements in a file, but what about: Syntax highlighting to have it readable? Direct execution from the file without pasting the cloud shell? Maybe, a big wish from Santa (-; executing a bunch of orders together like a powershell script??? -> .azcli is the answer! Azure CLI scrapbook files To get a solution for those points above, we need: Visual Studio Code Azure CLI CLI extension Saving the file with .azcli Using these tools and saving what we want to do as Scrapbook (.azcli) files, we get nice syntax highlighting, even with autocomplete. That means that if you start typing your cli command, key words are completed and (logged in into your Azure account) names e.g. for resource groups are checked and suggested for completion. To be honest, that\u2019s sometimes a bit too slow to get value from. Doing it this way, you can read the file proper and you are well prepared to execute the orders again. Executing With Visual Studio Code, there are two way to execute the orders: per line or all together Single line: Just put the mouse on the related line, right click (or short cut) and hit <run line in terminal> Watch the results in the terminal (or with the other option in a side-by-side editor) All together: In this demo case, I have a\n[3]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure --- Title: Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) - Overview | Microsoft Docs --- Body: Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) - Overview | Microsoft Docs Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) documentation The Azure command-line interface (Azure CLI) is a set of commands used to create and manage Azure resources.

Does OneLogin integrate with Azure active directory as a 'Directory' apart from the traditional on-prem AD DS. Is there any way to use Azure AD as a directory. There is an Azure AD application in the applications section, can we use it to import users from Azure AD? Seems like it's an SSO app only and does not do user provisioning/syncing! Out of desperation, I also tried the Azure AD Connect to sync to a dummy on-prem ADDS to Azure AD and then sync this dummy ADDS to OneLogin, but this seems like a very hackish way to do it and has it's own host of problems. I'm not able to figure out how to contact support; there is no support email mentioned on the website anywhere. Not similar to Connecting OneLogin to Azure Ad, as I am trying to add Azure Ad as a directory and the aforementioned question is about an error in federation configuration in Office 365 application of OneLogin. Any help on this would be immensely appreciated!

Choosing OneLogin Active Directory Integration for Your Office 365 Rollout Written By Chip EppsDecember 18, 2014 Situation: As I was reading some amazing stats from Microsoft like the recent Azure Active Directory (AAD) milestone of having just completed their 1 trillionth authentication, I had to acknowledge this feat out of sheer respect for the organization\u2019s achievement. Yet, at the same time I read about Microsoft\u2019s new Azure AD Connect which was previewed this week (beta started in August), and is anticipated to be GA in May 2015. Azure AD Connect is intended to be Microsoft\u2019s single tool for simplifying the AD premises-to-cloud connection process, including Office 365. Azure AD Connect reflects Microsoft\u2019s decision to move all their directory synchronization engines, including password synch, into Azure AD Connect. Microsoft has stated that Azure AD Connect is going to replace all other connecter tools in the Microsoft bag of tricks, including: Azure AD Sync (which in September was presented as the \u201cone sync to rule them all\u201d), and Office 365 DirSync (first introduced in 2008), Of course most people I\u2019ve spoken with say \u201cwhat is Azure AD Connect?\u201d. Perhaps more importantly, IT Admins view this with mixed emotions- either it\u2019s 1) Yeah, they\u2019re finally solving my problem and providing just one tool, or 2) Darn, I was just getting familiar with X, and now have to plan on implementing an entirely new tool. Figure: Previous approaches such as DirSync to align AD to Office 365 Challenge: With the introduction of Office 365 in 2011 the question arose, \u201chow best to authenticate my users to Office 365?\u201d Historically, synchronizing AD user credentials to Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based apps like Office 365 has been received with mixed response. When Windows XP and Office 2003 entered End of Support earlier this year, one of the migration recommendations was to adopt Windows 8.1 and Office 365. However, the complexity of extending Active Directory to the Office 365 infrastructure, and providing utilities supporting single sign-on functionality for the hundreds if not thousands of other non-Microsoft cloud applications being rolled out posed a problem. This helped open the door for providers like OneLogin who offer powerful AD integration features, strong authentication, and an expansive catalog of cloud application connectors. If Azure AD Connect is a path forward, some questions I would\n[3]: URL: https://comparisons.financesonline.com/onelogin-vs-microsoft-azure-active-directory --- Title: OneLogin vs Microsoft Azure Active Directory 2021 ... --- Body: OneLogin vs Microsoft Azure Active Directory 2022 Comparison | FinancesOnline Compare OneLogin vs Microsoft Azure Active Directory What is better OneLogin or Microsoft Azure Active Directory?

In this scenario, OneLogin's provisioning engine provides the functionality typically provided by Azure AD Connect in an ADFS-based federation architecture. For more information about how OneLogin works with Office 365, see Introduction To Office 365 Integration With OneLogin . Note: if your organization uses any workstations running Windows 10 or later, you need to activate your licenses with Office 365. Please see Configure Hybrid Azure Active Directory Join. Watch Video Training This article includes the following topics: Before you begin Enabling OneLogin provisioning to Office 365 Provisioning users automatically Provisioning users manually Using rules to provision Office 365 licenses to users Before you begin Configure SSO for Office 365 Confirm that you have a OneLogin plan that that includes provisioning. If your Office 365 implementation uses Windows Azure Active Directory Sync Service (Azure AD Connect): Decide whether to continue using Azure AD Connect with OneLogin SSO or to disable it in favor of OneLogin's provisioning engine. If you need to pass user attributes to Office 365 other than those listed in Provisioning User Attributes to Office 365, you should stick with Azure AD Connect. You can skip the instructions included in this article. You're done. If your needs will be met without Azure AD Connect, disable it. For instructions, see https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn144760.aspx Important! Verify that Azure AD Connect has gone through a full sync cycle before disabling it. Important! It can take up to 72 hours for Azure AD Connect deactivation to finish, depending on the number of objects in your Azure AD tenant. We recommend disabling Azure AD Connect at a time that will have minimal impact on your organization, such as a Friday evening. Office 365 Groups The Office 365 V2 connector only supports new Office 365 Groups, also called Unified Groups. The V2 connector doesn't support Classic Groups. There is only one group, Office 365 Groups, with two attributes: mailEnabled or securityEnabled. Distribution Lists are no longer supported.

Single Sign-On (SSO) Experience: OneLogin Azure AD integration enables users to sign in once with their Azure AD credentials and gain access to multiple applications without the need to enter credentials multiple times. This improves user experience and reduces password fatigue.\n\n3. Enhanced Security: OneLogin provides additional security measures, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and adaptive authentication, to protect user access to applications. With Azure AD integration, you can leverage these security features for a more robust access management solution.\n\n4. Application Integration: OneLogin offers a wide range of pre-built connectors for various cloud and on-premises applications. With Azure AD as the directory, you can easily connect and manage user access to these applications, simplifying the onboarding and offboarding processes.\n\n5. Customization and Flexibility: OneLogin allows you to customize the user experience, branding, and access policies to align with your organization's requirements.

This could be a brute force attack or someone is probably using a VPN to login anonymously. I do not think it's a virus as it's affecting multiple users at the same time.

Next steps This article explains how to move a Recovery Services vault configured for Azure Backup across Azure subscriptions, or to another resource group in the same subscription. You can use the Azure portal or PowerShell to move a Recovery Services vault. Supported regions All public regions and sovereign regions are supported, except France South, France Central, Germany Northeast and Germany Central. Prerequisites for moving Recovery Services vault During vault move across resource groups, both the source and target resource groups are locked preventing the write and delete operations. For more information, see this article. Only admin subscription has the permissions to move a vault. For moving vaults across subscriptions, the target subscription must reside in the same tenant as the source subscription and its state must be enabled. To move a vault to a different Azure AD, see Transfer subscription to a different directory and Recovery Service vault FAQs. You must have permission to perform write operations on the target resource group. Moving the vault only changes the resource group. The Recovery Services vault will reside on the same location and it can't be changed. You can move only one Recovery Services vault, per region, at a time. If a VM doesn't move with the Recovery Services vault across subscriptions, or to a new resource group, the current VM recovery points will remain intact in the vault until they expire. Whether the VM is moved with the vault or not, you can always restore the VM from the retained backup history in the vault. The Azure Disk Encryption requires that the key vault and VMs reside in the same Azure region and subscription. To move a virtual machine with managed disks, see this article.

A lot of my backups are using a recovery vault that stores its data in a storage account that shouldn't be used for this purpose. So I would like to redirect the backups to a new vault that uses the proper storage account, and then after a while delete the old vault.

I deploy VMs using templates in LCS for dynamics ax. Some users have permissions in LCS. So if a user wants to delete their demo/test VM via LCS, it deletes that resource group and everything in it.

In this article, you learn how to: Prepare Azure VMs. Create a vault. Discover VMs and configure a backup policy. Enable backup for Azure VMs. Run the initial backup. Note This article describes how to set up a vault and select VMs to back up. It's useful if you want to back up multiple VMs. Alternatively, you can back up a single Azure VM directly from the VM settings. Before you start Review the Azure VM backup architecture. Learn about Azure VM backup, and the backup extension. Review the support matrix before you configure backup. In addition, there are a couple of things that you might need to do in some circumstances: Install the VM agent on the VM: Azure Backup backs up Azure VMs by installing an extension to the Azure VM agent running on the machine. If your VM was created from an Azure Marketplace image, the agent is installed and running. If you create a custom VM, or you migrate an on-premises machine, you might need to install the agent manually. Note The functionality described in the following sections can also be accessed via Backup center. Backup center is a single unified management experience in Azure. It enables enterprises to govern, monitor, operate, and analyze backups at scale. With this solution, you can perform most of the key backup management operations without being limited to the scope of an individual vault. Create a Recovery Services vault A Recovery Services vault is a management entity that stores recovery points created over time and provides an interface to perform backup-related operations. These operations include taking on-demand backups, performing restores, and creating backup policies. To create a Recovery Services vault: Sign in to your subscription in the Azure portal. Search for Backup center in the Azure portal, and go to the Backup Center dashboard. Select +Vault from the Overview tab. Select Recovery Services vault > Continue.

While I feel that Microsoft will eventually make this potentially painful process something of the pass, it can be a daunting task today as I write this post. To help demystify a common operation that is made, I would like to demonstrate how to move an Azure virtual machine and the Recovery Services Vault with its backups from one subscription to another. Microsoft Documentation To begin, I would like to provide the following three links that should be reviewed to understand the operations this post will be demonstrating: Move resources to a new resource group or subscription https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-resource-group-and-subscription Move a Recovery Services vault across Azure Subscriptions and Resource Groups https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-move-recovery-services-vault?toc=/azure/azure-resource-manager/toc.json Move operation support for resources https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-support-resources Move guidance for virtual machines https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-limitations/virtual-machines-move-limitations Test Environment The following are the two Pay-as-you-go subscriptions I\u2019ll be using: The following is the Test-VM I will be moving from Azure Source Sub to Azure Destination Sub (note that tags are configured for this VM): The following are the components all placed into the resource group RG-VMs and their respective Resource IDs, which will change after the subscription move: Virtual Machine: /subscriptions/b0957dbf-1cad-4e5e-9360-341ccc197953/resourceGroups/RG-VMs/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/Test-VM VM NIC: /subscriptions/b0957dbf-1cad-4e5e-9360-341ccc197953/resourceGroups/RG-VMs/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/Test-VM-nic-9190f27cc6cc40a3bede740db168b0d3 VM Public IP with Basic SKU (basic SKU IP addresses can be moved but standard cannot): /subscriptions/b0957dbf-1cad-4e5e-9360-341ccc197953/resourceGroups/RG-VMs/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/Test-VM-pip-90462821bc164f12a624afccf204b93c VNet: /subscriptions/b0957dbf-1cad-4e5e-9360-341ccc197953/resourceGroups/RG-VMs/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/Test-VNet VM Disk: /subscriptions/b0957dbf-1cad-4e5e-9360-341ccc197953/resourceGroups/RG-VMs/providers/Microsoft.Compute/disks/testvm-osdisk-20210424-103611 The following is the Recovery Services Vault that is configured to backup the Test-VM: The following is the backup status for the Test-VM (note that there are backups configured and a few restore points): Different behavior during Subscription to Subscription Move I\u2019ve found that the subscription to subscription move operation changes depending on when you run it.

Today, we are pleased to announce the general availability support of the move functionality for recovery services vaults. With this feature you can migrate a vault between subscriptions and resource groups with a few steps, in minimal downtime and without any data-loss of old backups. You can move a Recovery Services vault and retain recovery points of protected virtual machines (VMs) to restore to any point in time later. Key benefits Flexibility to move across subscriptions and resource groups: You can move the vault across resource groups and subscriptions. This is very helpful in scenarios like expiry of old subscription, moving from an Enterprise Agreement to Cloud Solution Provider subscription, organizational and departmental changes, or separation between QA environment and production environment. No impact to old restore points and settings in the vault: Post migration, all the settings, backup policies, and configurations in the vault are retained, including all backup and recovery points created in the past inside the vault. Restore support independent of the VM in the old subscription: You can restore from retained backup history in the vault regardless of whether the VM is moved with the vault or not to the target subscription.

Rogue Azure Active Directories don\u2019t sound like a huge and widespread problem, but Microsoft\u2019s approach of generating unmanaged, viral AAD tenants whenever they encounter the tiniest reason to do so MUST be driven by some weird internal scorecard where \u201cnumber of tenants\u201d has a lot of weight, because you do get an Azure AD tenant really easily, and getting rid of one is surprisingly laborious. This guide aims to explain what\u2019s the quickest way to remove one. Background Table of Contents Unmanaged directories can be troublesome because they are just that \u2013 unmanaged. And one can get created for your Xbox live account, and the next time you\u2019re trying to buy more vbucks in Fortnite, instead of a credit card number, you\u2019re asked to input the MFA code from Microsoft Authenticator \u2013 the only problem being, you have never configured MFA for your account (don\u2019t worry \u2013 I know you\u2019re better than that! \u2013 But for the sake of argument, let\u2019s suppose that you\u2019re not) and have no idea where you might get a code. That\u2019s what viral AAD will do to you. Well, that and Azure Active Directory Security Defaults. But let\u2019s not go there. That\u2019s a rabbit hole for another time, and perhaps for someone else to write about. So how do you get your account to be managed by an unmanaged Azure Active Directory tenant? How does your private, personal Xbox live/OneDrive/Teams Personal account get infected by a viral directory, hampering down your access forever?

Your Work or School Account was created using self-service signup for Azure Active Directory (also known as a \"viral tenant\"). To continue using the Volume Licensing Service Center, you must take over your unmanaged directory as an administrator. Why am I getting a limited number of sign-in opportunities using a Microsoft Account How do I sign up for a new Work or School Account What is an unmanaged tenant How do I know if I have an unmanaged tenant account What is a viral tenant takeover How do I perform a viral tenant takeover Contact Assisted Support Why is Microsoft is transitioning to managed Work or School Accounts for VLSC Sign in Microsoft is increasingly transitioning volume licensing capabilities to modern platforms such as M365 Admin Center that require Work or School Accounts. Transitioning to Work or School Accounts means users can have a single Log In ID to manage on-premises software, on-line services and subscriptions such as Visual Studio on the Volume Licensing Service Center and other Microsoft sites. Other benefits of Work or School Accounts include: Best-in-class user authentication and authorization, and are the best option to protect the enterprise assets that are acquired through the Microsoft Volume License programs Accounts are more secure because individual users are more readily identifiable as belonging to an organization and users\u2019 access is removed once they are no longer part of their organization\u2019s active directory. Forgotten passwords can be reset by the organization\u2019s global administrator, or by self-service password reset if the Global Admin allows it. What is a Work or School Accounts for VLSC Sign in A Work or School Account typically takes the form of username@orgname.com or username@orgname.onmicrosoft.com (where orgname is their employer's email domain name). This helps customers and Microsoft alike to validate the user's assigned permissions are accurately and securely affiliated with the licensed organization.

It's really annoying I have to convert common things to \"Microsoft Speak\". I also don't like that there is a seeming lack of consistency in terminology while reading the documentation. It makes me not want to use Azure. For example, look at the PIM documentation >Azure AD roles \u2013 Sometimes referred to as directory roles, Azure AD roles include built-in and custom roles to manage Azure AD and other Microsoft 365 online services. The key word is _sometimes_. Okay, when are Azure AD roles referred to as Directory Roles? Why not just call them \"Azure AD Roles\" like the documentation does? I know this is a trivial example, but you can imagine these types of inconsistencies are rampant in the Azure documentation. 63 comments 50 Posted by u/AzureTerraform 3 days ago New Terraform on Azure Preview Features: AzAPI, Azure Terrafy, and Verified Modules in Development General Hi All!

The process of taking ownership of a viral tenant and managing it is described in Microsoft documentation[[2]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/faq)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of such viral tenants?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The benefits of using viral tenants include:\n1. Flexibility: Viral tenants allow users from different organizations to collaborate and access shared resources.\n2. Easy setup: These tenants are created automatically when a user accepts an invitation, eliminating the need for manual tenant creation.\n3. Seamless sign-in: Users from the inviting organization can sign in using their existing Azure AD account credentials.\n4. Collaboration: Viral tenants enable organizations to easily collaborate with external users without the need for complex integration or user provisioning processes.\n\nIt's important to note that viral tenants are unmanaged and may have limitations compared to managed tenants. For detailed information and best practices, I recommend referring to Microsoft's documentation on viral tenants[[[2]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/faq)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/faq)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Alright, what does the Microsoft document say about the use of viral tenants in Azure AD?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "According to Microsoft's documentation, viral tenants, also known as unmanaged tenants, are created on the fly when a user accepts an invitation to join an Azure AD directory from a different organization. These tenants are not managed by any specific organization and allow users from the inviting organization to sign in using their Azure AD account. However, there are some considerations and limitations when using viral tenants:\n\n1. Limited capabilities: Viral tenants may have limited functionality compared to managed tenants, as they are not associated with a specific organization's IT infrastructure.\n\n2. Governance challenges: Managing access and security within viral tenants can be more complex, as there is no centralized administration or control.\n\n3. Takeover process: If an organization wants to take ownership of a viral tenant and manage it like a regular Azure AD tenant, there is a process outlined in the documentation to go through, known as \"tenant takeover.\"\n\nFor more information on viral tenants and best practices for their use, I recommend referring to Microsoft's documentation [[[2]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/faq)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/faq)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is there any other important information about viral tenants that I should be aware of?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, there are a few additional points to keep in mind about viral tenants:\n\n1. Tenant takeover: If an organization wants to take control and manage a viral tenant, they can initiate a tenant takeover process. This process allows the organization to bring the tenant under their management and apply their own governance policies.\n\n2. Security considerations: Viral tenants may have different security policies and settings compared to managed tenants. It's important to ensure that the necessary security measures are in place within viral tenants to protect the organization's data and resources.\n\n3. Collaboration and external users: Viral tenants are often used to facilitate collaboration with external users from different organizations. Organizations can invite external users to their viral tenant and grant them the necessary access to collaborate on shared resources.\n\n4. Considerations for organizational accounts: If an organization uses Azure AD and invites users from a different organization to their viral tenant, it's important to consider the impact on the invited users' organizational accounts.

In this article, I will explain some of the core differentiation between those two terms. What are Azure AD Roles? Azure AD is nothing but an identity store in Azure. Here we can define users, groups, applications, and service principles. These users can authenticate onto Azure and they can access resources that are part of Azure subscription. We can assign Azure AD roles to a user and these permissions are normally given to manage the various aspects of Azure AD. Let\u2019s say we want to give a user the ability to register applications in Azure, then we can assign them as application administrator role or let's say we want to give the ability for a user to manage groups, then we can assign the group's administrator role to the user. What is Role-Based Access Control? On the other hand, role-based access control (RBAC) is meant to authorize a user to use resources in Azure. So for example, you could give a role for a user to go ahead and give them the ability to create a storage account or to manage resource groups. Role-based access control can be given at the management group level, subscription level, resource group level, or at the resource level. RBAC has three basic roles that apply to all resource types: Owner This role has full access to all the resources and can delegate access to others. Contributor This role can create and manage all types of resources, but can\u2019t grant access to other users and groups. Reader This role can view existing Azure resources. Assigning Azure AD Roles Go to Azure Active Directory, and go to the Users section => click on a user for whom you want to add an AD Role. Now we can Assign roles for the user => Click on Assigned Role => + Add assignments. Now you will see a list of available Azure AD roles. You can select any role and click on the Add button. You will then see the role assigned to the user. Assigning Role-Based Access Control As we know, RBAC is used\n[4]: URL: https://cloudinfrastructureservices.co.uk/designing-azure-subscription-vs-resource-groups-best-practices --- Title: Designing \ue000Azure\ue001 Subscription vs Resource \ue000Groups\ue001 Best ... --- Body: Designing Azure Subscription vs Resource Groups Best Practices Designing Azure Subscription vs Resource Groups Best Practices by Andrew Fitzgerald in Azure Comments Before you start using Azure, you need to first design how you want your workloads to run and consider whether to use multiple Azure subscriptions for each workload/client or to use 1 Azure tenant with multiple Azure Resource Groups and restrict access at the Resource Group level to your users/workloads. I\u2019ve put together this best practice model with pros and cons for each design model. This can be used as a starting point when designing your Azure patterns. In this tutorial i will walk you through the following: First you need to choose how you want to design your Azure subscription model. I\u2019ve put together 2 options below. Next you need to decide how you want to design your Azure Resource Group model. I\u2019ve put together 2 options below Then you need to plan how you\u2019re going to manage access and implement an role based access control strategy. You also need to think about your naming standards best practice, especially if you have several teams deploying resources into Azure. Ok lets first start with choosing your Azure Subscription Model: Option 1) Azure Multiple Subscription Model Best Practices In Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), a tenant is representative of an organization. It is a dedicated instance of the Azure AD service that an organization receives and owns when it signs up for a Microsoft cloud service such as Azure, Microsoft Intune, or Office 365. Each Azure AD tenant is distinct and separate from other Azure AD tenants An Azure tenant can have multiple subscriptions Each subscription can use the same Azure AD As per the diagram above, we have 4 subscriptions under 1 Azure AD Tenant 1) Azure Subscription for Identity / Management Host Active Directory IaaS DCs / DNS / ADFS and Any Management Servers. Operational staff members, cloud engineers, cloud security teams would have access to this subscription and manage the infrastructure in this subscription. This subscription would be the heartbeat (hub) of your Azure tenant. 2) Azure Subscription for Testing / UAT Environment Use for any testing, preview of Azure features in a test environment. As the name suggests this will be used for testing new features that you want to implement into production environments. Testing teams would have access to this subscription. 3) Azure Subscription\n[5]: URL: https://linkedin.com/pulse/azure-policy-vs-initiative-rbac-locks-manan-shah --- Title: Azure Policy Vs Azure Initiative Vs Azure RBAC Vs Azure Locks --- Body: Azure Policy Vs Azure Initiative Vs Azure RBAC Vs Azure Locks Azure Policy Vs Azure Initiative Vs Azure RBAC Vs Azure Locks Manan Shah DevOps & Infrastructure Engineer at Motorola Solutions Published Oct 18, 2020 + Follow All the above mentioned subjects are ways to control and organize Azure resources. Major difference is that Azure Policy and Azure Initiatives are Pre-deployment practices while Azure RBAC and Azure locks are Post-deployment practices. Lets dive in more and figure out how each one of them are different from each other! Starting with . . . Azure Policy - Policies ensured that all the employees with Azure access are following our internal standards for creating resources. Example - You may need your team to add an environmental / departmental tag for every resource. This helps you to track that resource as well as monitor expenses / cost management purpose. Here is a JSON snippet that can be used to enforce the above example: { \"mode\": \"Indexed\", \"policyRule\": { \"if\": { \"field\": \"[concat('tags[', parameters('tagName'), ']')]\", \"exists\": \"false\" }, \"then\": { \"effect\": \"deny\" } }, \"parameters\": { \"tagName\": { \"type\": \"String\", \"metadata\": { \"displayName\": \"Tag Name\", \"description\": \"Name of the tag, such as 'environment'\" } } } } Azure Initiative - Initiative is a collection of Azure policy definitions that are grouped together towards a specific goal or purpose in mind. Azure initiatives simplify management of your policies by grouping a set of policies together as one single item. Example - you could use the PCI-DSS built-in initiative which has all the policy definitions that are centered around meeting PCI-DSS compliance. Now, while implementing Azure Policy ensured that all our employees with Azure access are following our internal standards for creating resources, but we have a second issue we need to solve: how do we protect those resources once they are deployed? That's, when RBAC and Locks come into play RBAC - RBAC provides fine-grained access management for Azure resources, enabling you to grant users the specific rights they need to perform their jobs. RBAC is considered a core service and is included with all subscription levels at no cost. Examples for RBAC - Allow one user to manage VMs in a subscription, and another user to manage virtual networks. Allow a database administrator (DBA) group to manage SQL databases in a subscription. Allow an application to access all resources in a resource group. Azure\n", "messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!

This can prevent the users from joining devices into AAD.

A hybrid joined computer is joined to both AD and AAD, but the AD join is primary because the device initially uses AD authentication. Only Windows devices can be hybrid joined. The benefits of having Hybrid Azure AD Join devices are The computer has a device object in Azure AD, which enables a variety of capabilities including: Microsoft 365 Apps device licensing is possible Azure AD Conditional Access features based on device conditions are possible There is a reduction in user sign ins because user sign in gets both an NETID AD token and AAD token But what If you want to disable that Hybrid Join? You can disable hybrid join by preventing one of the requirement elements from triggering hybrid join registration: Modify the Hybrid Azure ADJoin from the AADConnect (Recommended) Use the following registry in the computers to block: HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WorkplaceJoin: \u201cBlockAADWorkplaceJoin\u201d=dword:00000001 Modify the Scheduled Task which triggers AAD device registration. See Task Scheduler > Microsoft > Windows > Workplace Join > Automatic-Device-Join. See the following 3 items for details: Deleting the Scheduled Task seems to work reliably. Disabling the Scheduled Task does not work reliably; the disabled task will still run after a user signs in. Modify both triggers from an Enabled status to a Disabled status; this works reliably. Add a firewall block for https://enterpriseregistration.windows.net, to prevent the computer from connecting to the Azure AD Device Registration Service (AAD DRS). See the following item for possible side-effects: This should only affect the ability to AAD join. If you have Office installed on the Windows device, this might have an undesirable impact on AAD device registration (different from AAD device join) which is required per user for Microsoft 365 Apps (was Office 365 ProPlus) sign-in.

The constant use of information technology throughout the day, along with easy access of information, is blurring traditional boundaries between work and home life. These shifting boundaries are accompanied by a belief that personal technology-selected and customized to fit users' personalities, activities, and schedules-should extend into the workplace. To accommodate the growing requirement of personal consumer devices to be connected to enterprise networks, we are introducing the following value propositions: Administrators can control who has access to company resources that are based on application, user, device, and location. Employees can access applications and data everywhere, on any device. Employees can use Single Sign-On in browser applications or enterprise applications. Key concepts introduced in the solution Workplace Join By using Workplace Join, information workers can join their personal devices with their company's workplace computers to access company resources and services. When you join your personal device to your workplace, it becomes a known device and provides seamless second factor authentication and Single Sign-On to workplace resources and applications. When a device is joined by Workplace Join, attributes of the device can be retrieved from the directory to drive conditional access for the purpose of authorizing issuance of security tokens for applications. Windows 8.1 and iOS 6.0+, and Android 4.0+ devices can be joined by using Workplace Join. Azure Active Directory Device Registration service Workplace Join is made possible by the Azure Active Directory Device Registration service. When a device is joined by Workplace Join, the service provisions a device object in Azure Active Directory and then sets a key on the local device that is used to represent the device identity. This device identity can then be used with access control rules for applications that are hosted in the cloud and on-premises.

My main goal was to test functionality of our LoB apps, but I pretty immediately became distracted with the option to perform an Azure AD Join instead of a traditional domain join. After the initial installation, you\u2019ll be given these options: Of course I had an \u201cOooh, lets play with the new thing!\u201d moment and had to try the Join Azure AD option. I was able to sign in with my o365 credentials, and was then prompted to create a PIN, with some vague statements saying that it is faster than a password. Since our Mobile Device policies are all default in o365, I assume this will be the case for most people. There is initially no option to skip this step, but if you click Create PIN, then close the popup, you get a new button that allows you to skip the PIN (but it will prompt you again each time you log in). After the Azure AD Join, you\u2019ll find that the machine is not actually domain joined, and is just a workgroup member. No GPO gets applied, and the computer does not appear in your on-prem Active Directory.

Even though it is not very complex or advanced, still it meet recruiters and interviewers with appreciation. I\u2019d like to share my experience of this examination and some key tips and resources. The variety of topics, most scenario-based, which are evaluated on the exam pertain to the key areas of Cloud services, IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, types of Cloud, Azure architectural components like Azure Resource Manager, management tools in Azure, Azure ML, Cognitive Services, Security, NSG, Governance, SLAs. The best resource to learn and upgrade yourself is of course the Official Microsoft Training Videos. And the one most important document not to miss out on during your preparation and as part of your study toolkit is the Official AZ-900 Study Guide. The reason being this Official Guide categorically lists the topics in such a methodical way that it is impossible to fail the exam if you duly read on each topic. Then practice sufficiently at the Free Azure Fundamentals AZ-900 Microsoft Practice Exam I helped collab to verify your readiness.

Protection Against Password-Based Attacks: MFA mitigates the risk of password-based attacks, such as phishing or brute force attacks. Even if an attacker manages to obtain a user's password, they would still be unable to access the account without the additional verification factor.\n\n3. Compliance with Security Standards: MFA is often required to meet compliance regulations and security standards in various industries. It helps organizations adhere to best practices and ensure the security of their systems and data.\n\n4. User Convenience: While MFA adds an extra step to the authentication process, it can be designed to be user-friendly and convenient. Many MFA solutions offer options such as push notifications to mobile devices or biometric authentication, making it easier for users to verify their identity quickly.\n\n5. Secure Remote Access: MFA is particularly beneficial for remote access scenarios, such as RDP connections. It adds an additional layer of security to ensure that only authorized users can connect to remote systems, protecting against potential unauthorized access from external networks.\n\nOverall, MFA is a powerful security measure that enhances the security posture of organizations by providing an additional layer of authentication, preventing unauthorized access, and protecting sensitive data and resources."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Disadvantages of MFA."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) offers numerous advantages in terms of security, there are a few potential disadvantages to consider:\n\n1. Complexity: Implementing MFA can introduce added complexity to the authentication process, both for users and administrators. Users might find it more time-consuming or confusing to complete the additional verification steps, and administrators may need to configure and manage the MFA system.\n\n2. User Experience: Depending on the MFA method used, users may experience additional steps or delays during the authentication process. This can impact user experience and potentially lead to frustration if the verification methods are slow or inconvenient.\n\n3. Cost: Implementing MFA may require additional investments in terms of hardware, software, or licensing. These costs can vary depending on the chosen MFA solution, the number of users to be protected, and the level of support required.\n\n4. Dependence on External Factors: Some MFA methods rely on external factors, such as mobile devices or biometric data, which may introduce dependencies and potential issues. For example, if a user's smartphone is lost or not functioning, they may not be able to complete the MFA verification.\n\n5. Compatibility: Not all systems or applications may support MFA, or integration may require additional development or configuration. This can limit the effectiveness and applicability of MFA in certain environments.\n\nDespite these potential disadvantages, the added security and protection offered by MFA often outweigh the drawbacks, making it a valuable security measure for many organizations."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Ok, thanks."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You're welcome!

These FAQs cover questions about how to use the service, which includes the billing model, capabilities, limitations, and support. General questions I manage multiple Azure AD directories. How do I switch to the one that has Azure Active Directory Premium? To switch between different Azure AD tenants, select the currently signed-in User Name on the upper-right corner, and then choose the appropriate account. If the account is not listed here, select Sign out, and then use the global admin credentials of the directory that has Azure Active Directory Premium (P1 or P2) enabled to sign in. What version of identity roles are supported by Azure AD Connect Health? The following table lists the roles and supported operating system versions. Role Operating system / Version Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) Windows Server 2012 Windows Server 2012 R2 Windows Server 2016 Windows Server 2019 Azure AD Connect Version 1.0.9125 or higher Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) Windows Server 2012 Windows Server 2012 R2 Windows Server 2016 Windows Server 2019 Windows Server Core installations are not supported. Note that the features provided by the service may differ based on the role and the operating system. In other words, all the features may not be available for all operating system versions. See the feature descriptions for details. How many licenses do I need to monitor my infrastructure? The first Connect Health Agent requires at least one Azure AD Premium (P1 or P2) license. Each additional registered agent requires 25 additional Azure AD Premium (P1 or P2) licenses. Agent count is equivalent to the total number of agents that are registered across all monitored roles (AD FS, Azure AD Connect, and/or AD DS). AAD Connect Health licensing does not require you to assign the license to specific users. You only need to have the requisite number of valid licenses.

But as apps have migrated to the Web, the trend towards increasing client-side functionality has ground to a virtual halt. There are several reasons for this; chief among them are security and deployment problems. But that's all about to change. With the .NET Framework, you can participate in building the distributable rich client of the future. In this article, the author enumerates the pertinent features of .NET that will allow you to build safe, easily deployable controls. The features discussed include managed code, code access security, versioning control, Windows Forms classes, and isolation.. n all of the recent coverage of the Microsoft\u00ae .NET Framework, I have yet to see discussed the return of the rich client. A rich client is any software running natively on a client machine. This includes traditional applications like word processors and spreadsheets, and also includes Web-deployed executables such as legacy ActiveX\u00ae controls and the new Windows\u00ae Forms controls. Examining the rich client requires a look at a number of seemingly unrelated features of the .NET Framework such as Windows Forms and security. So what makes the rich client rich? The rich client has access to the windowing and GUI features of the operating system on which it runs. This means drag and drop editing, toolbars and menus, animation, and all of the other bells and whistles. These are the features that are often difficult or impossible to implement using markup languages such as HTML or even DHTML. The rich client also has access to other local resources such as the file system, printers, and sound cards. Yet more and more software is being written with limited or no access to these features. Why is that? After I talk\n[2]: URL: https://techopedia.com/definition/16012/rich-client --- Title: What is Rich Client? - Definition from Techopedia --- Body: What is Rich Client? - Definition from Techopedia Dictionary Networking Rich Client Rich Client Last updated: April 25, 2012 What Does Rich Client Mean? A rich client is a networked computer falling between a fat client and a thin client. Fat refers to a computer with many locally-stored programs/resources and little network resource dependence. Thin refers to a computer with few locally-stored programs/resources and great network resource dependence. Thus, a rich client depends both on locally-stored programs/resources and those available through the network server. Advertisement Techopedia Explains Rich Client A rich client balances program/resource dependence and hard drive or connected drive resources on its devices with program/resource dependence on the network server\u2019s hard drive or connected drives and devices. The system designer determines this balance, depending on whether lengthy computations must be accomplished by the client or the server. As an example, the computer handling a simple drawing\u2019s editing with sophisticated software stored on a network server is often considered as a thin client. A computer handling most of a complex drawing\u2019s editing with locally-stored sophisticated editing software may be considered a fat client. Editing or viewing accessibility to the drawing and editing software is determined by the system designer.

Ilya Bukshteyn, a group program manager on Microsoft's .Net developer partner and customer team, outlined the issues as follows: Problem 1: Deployment of rich-client applications was too complex and costly, particularly in comparison with Web applications that required no client deployment. Cause: To install Windows client-based applications that were written using either Visual Basic Forms or C++ with Microsoft's Component Object Model (COM), users needed to develop an installation application or a set of installation scripts. [ Keep up on the latest thought leadership, insights, how-to, and analysis on IT through Computerworld\u2019s newsletters. ] Because the Windows Registry needed to be updated with the COM components, the installation scripts often became very complex, and in many cases, testers were needed to check the installation, not just the application itself. How Microsoft addressed the problem: The .Net framework's Windows Forms are a set of class libraries and a design environment for building user interfaces. \"No-touch deployment\" allows a company to distribute a Windows Forms application to all of its users by copying files to a server and distributing a URL that points to a Web page, triggering the download of the application. If the application has merely been updated, only those pieces of the application that have changed are downloaded. In most cases, this is done over a LAN or virtual private network. No installer or installation script is needed. Problem 2: Applications that rely on the same Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) may cease to run after a component in one of the applications is changed or updated. This problem is commonly referred to as \"DLL hell.\" DLL files routinely store COM components in the Windows environment. A COM component is a discrete piece of functionality in an application, such as the spell checker in a word processing program or the chart-creation engine in a spreadsheet. [ FREE report!

AZ- 204 is for developers writing and hosting apps in Azure. For both you need \"subject matter expertise\" in the subjects being tested - I work in infrastructure consulting and don't know a single \"infra guy\" who has taken 204! As a software engineer, I would suggest you focus on 204 and have a run at AZ-900. That would give you a good generally knowledge of Azure without the need for 12+ months hands on infrastructure work.

Direct I/O The most common parameter used in storage performance benchmarking is direct I/O. It is supported by FIO and Vdbench. DISKSPD offers support for the similar construct of memory-mapped I/O. With direct I/O, the filesystem cache is bypassed, operations for direct memory access copy are avoided, and storage tests are made fast and simple. Using the direct I/O parameter makes storage testing easy. No data is read from the filesystem cache on the client. As such, the test is truly stressing the storage protocol and service itself, rather than memory access speeds. Also, without the DMA memory copies, read and write operations are efficient from a processing perspective. Take the Linux dd command as an example workload. Without the optional odirect flag, all I/O generated by dd is served from the Linux buffer cache. Reads with the blocks already in memory are not retrieved from storage. Reads resulting in a buffer cache miss end up being read from storage using NFS read-ahead with varying results, depending on factors as mount rsize and client read-ahead tunables. When writes are sent through the buffer cache, they use a write-behind mechanism, which is untuned and uses a significant amount of parallelism to send the data to the storage device. You might attempt to run two independent streams of I/O, one dd for reads and one dd for writes. But in fact, the operating system, untuned, favors writes over reads and uses more parallelism of it. Aside from database, few applications use direct I/O. Instead, they choose to leverage the advantages of a large memory cache for repeated reads and a write behind cache for asynchronous writes. In short, using direct I/O turns the test into a micro benchmark if the application being synthesized uses the filesystem cache. The following are some databases that support direct I/O: Oracle SAP HANA MySQL (InnoDB storage engine) RocksDB PostgreSQL Teradata Best practices Testing with directio is an excellent way to understand the limits of the storage service and client. To get a better understanding for how the application itself will behave\n[2]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/performance-virtual-machine-sku --- Title: Azure virtual machine SKUs best practices for Azure NetApp ... --- Body: Azure virtual machine SKUs best practices for Azure NetApp Files | Microsoft Docs Azure Azure NetApp Files Azure virtual machine SKUs best practices for Azure NetApp Files Article 01/02/2022 3 minutes to read 2 contributors In this article SKU selection considerations Differences within and between SKUs Best practices Next steps This article describes Azure NetApp Files best practices about Azure virtual machine SKUs, including differences within and between SKUs. SKU selection considerations Storage performance involves more than the speed of the storage itself. The processor speed and architecture have a lot to do with the overall experience from any particular compute node. As part of the selection process for a given SKU, you should consider the following factors: AMD or Intel: For example, SAS uses a math kernel library designed specifically for Intel processors. In this case, Intel SKUs are preferred over AMD SKU. The F2, E_v3, and D_v3 machine types are each based on more than one chipset. In using Azure Dedicated Hosts, you might select specific models (Broadwell, Cascade Lake, or Skylake when selecting the E type for example). Otherwise, the chipset selection is non-deterministic. If you are deploying an HPC cluster and a consistent experience across the inventory is important, then you can consider single Azure Dedicated Hosts or go with single chipset SKUs such as the E_v4 or D_v4. Performance variability with network-attached storage (NAS) has been observed in testing with both the Intel Broadwell based SKUs and the AMD EPYC\u2122 7551 based SKUs. Two issues have been observed: When the accelerated network interface is inappropriately mapped to a sub optimal NUMA Node, read performance decreases significantly. Although mapping the accelerated networking interface to a specific NUMA node is beneficial on newer SKUs, it must be considered a requirement on SKUs with these chipsets (Lv2|E_v3|D_v3). Virtual machines running on the Lv2, or either E_v3 or D_v3 running on a Broadwell chipset are more susceptible to resource contention than when running on other SKUs. When testing using multiple virtual machines running within a single Azure Dedicated Host, running network-based storage workload from one virtual machine has been seen to decrease the performance of network-based storage workloads running from a second virtual machine. The decrease is more pronounced when any of the virtual machines on the node have not had their accelerated network interface/NUMA node optimally mapped. Keep in mind that the E_v3 and D_V3 may between them\n[3]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/performance-linux-mount-options --- Title: Linux NFS mount options best practices for Azure NetApp Files --- Body: Linux NFS mount options best practices for Azure NetApp Files | Microsoft Docs Azure Azure NetApp Files Linux NFS mount options best practices for Azure NetApp Files Article 01/02/2022 8 minutes to read 2 contributors In this article Nconnect Rsize and Wsize Close-to-open consistency and cache attribute timers Next steps This article helps you understand mount options and the best practices for using them with Azure NetApp Files. Nconnect Using the nconnect mount option allows you to specify the number of connections (network flows) that should be established between the NFS client and NFS endpoint up to a limit of 16. Traditionally, an NFS client uses a single connection between itself and the endpoint. By increasing the number of network flows, the upper limits of I/O and throughput are increased significantly. Testing has found nconnect=8 to be the most performant. When preparing a multi-node SAS GRID environment for production, you might notice a repeatable 30% reduction in run time going from 8 hours to 5.5 hours: Mount option Job run times No nconnect 8 hours nconnect=8 5.5 hours Both sets of tests used the same E32-8_v4 virtual machine and RHEL8.3, with read-ahead set to 15 MiB. When you use nconnect, keep the following rules in mind: nconnect is supported by Azure NetApp Files on all major Linux distributions but only on newer releases: Linux release NFSv3 (minimum release) NFSv4.1 (minimum release) Redhat Enterprise Linux RHEL8.3 RHEL8.3 SUSE SLES12SP4 or SLES15SP1 SLES15SP2 Ubuntu Ubuntu18.04 Note SLES15SP2 is the minimum SUSE release in which nconnect is supported by Azure NetApp Files for NFSv4.1. All other releases as specified are the first releases that introduced the nconnect feature. All mounts from a single endpoint will inherit the nconnect setting of the first export mounted, as shown in the following scenarios: Scenario 1: nconnect is used by the first mount. Therefore, all mounts against the same endpoint use nconnect=8. mount 10.10.10.10:/volume1 /mnt/volume1 -o nconnect=8 mount 10.10.10.10:/volume2 /mnt/volume2 mount 10.10.10.10:/volume3 /mnt/volume3 Scenario 2: nconnect is not used by the first mount. Therefore, no mounts against the same endpoint use nconnect even though nconnect may be specified thereon. mount 10.10.10.10:/volume1 /mnt/volume1 mount 10.10.10.10:/volume2 /mnt/volume2 -o nconnect=8 mount 10.10.10.10:/volume3 /mnt/volume3 -o nconnect=8 Scenario 3: nconnect settings are not propagated across separate storage endpoints. nconnect is used by the mount coming from 10.10.10.10 but not by the mount coming from 10.12.12.12. mount 10.10.10.10:/volume1 /mnt/volume1 -o nconnect=8 mount 10.12.12.12:/volume2\n[4]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/windows/performance-guidelines-best-practices-checklist --- Title: \ue000Checklist\ue001: \ue000Best\ue001 \ue000practices\ue001 & guidelines - \ue000SQL Server\ue001 on ... --- Body: Checklist: Best practices & guidelines - SQL Server on Azure VMs | Microsoft Docs Azure Azure SQL SQL Server on Azure VM Windows Checklist: Best practices for SQL Server on Azure VMs Article 04/05/2022 14 minutes to read 16 contributors In this article Overview VM Size Storage SQL Server features Azure features HADR configuration Security Next steps APPLIES TO: SQL Server on Azure VM This article provides a quick checklist as a series of best practices and guidelines to optimize performance of your SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs).

I can still expose myself to risks unknowingly. I\u2019ve been working with Azure Static Web Apps for many months now, and they\u2019re awesome! Often in tutorials or getting started guides, we try to make the code and directions as easy as possible for anyone to be able to follow. While this is great for the community, sometimes while we make things easy to get started, but do not consider the impact it can have on the consumer. Meaning, I have deployed my Azure Static Web App, but exposed myself to what could a potential security risk for myself or my organization. In hindsight, we need to make sure our tutorials are fit for purpose and production. In the tutorial, I have a very simple repo in Azure DevOps where I keep my code. I want to deploy my Azure Static Web App using a simple repository, which I walk you through in this tutorial. The tutorial is easy to follow and aims to get people started on their DevOps journey, so we really want to start with a simple version of code. Many will bring their own code, or maybe start with this super simple repo. In the tutorial I started with a very basic, vanilla build, if you will. I copied the repo, deployed my static web app and had a full CI/CD pipeline up and running within minutes. As a developer, we should ALL care about security. We want to \u2018shift left\u2019 and implement security early. While nothing obvious sticks out, I don\u2019t have any exposed secrets in my YAML, I\u2019ve done all the things right. But wait.. I haven\u2019t. I dare you as the reader to look at my repo and see what I exposed? Find it yet? Answer: I deployed my app from the root of the folder. When Azure DevOps created the pipeline and I wrote my YAML, it was also exposing all files in the root folder.

Keep in mind that this assumes a lot of things as this won't preserve user, data, applications, or configuration so you need to be prepared to deploy these from whatever management tool you are using (Intune and/or ConfigMgr in the Microsoft ecosystem). Unregistering from AAD isn't necessary. Technically, you could certainly unjoin the on-prem domain and then join AAD but as Nick noted, this will orphan the user's profile and there are no supported Microsoft tools to migrate user profiles for this scenario. 0 NickHogarth-MVP answered \u2022 Aug 04 2020 at 3:40 PM It isn't very clean to go from on-prem AD joined to Azure AD joined as it might orphan user profiles and possibly mess up file system and registry URL's.

Archived Forums > Microsoft Intune Question 0 Sign in to vote In reading about Windows Autopilot and exercising its basic green-field scenario, that seems almost simple enough https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/windows-autopilot/demonstrate-deployment-on-vm but I am struck by how difficult it has been to find any documentation that details on the brown-field scenario of converting a group of existing AAD-registered devices to AAD-joined. This should be a fairly common scenario, as organisations would usually slowly step up with small increments the level of sophistication they'd operate and manage their devices. (And we don't even need to deal with the hybrid scenario since we don't operate our own internal AD domains/forest.) What is the official procedure to handle these conversions for deeper device management? PS - I can't find any Azure AD forum in this TechNet site, and Microsoft Intune seems to be closest related.

Computers were issued to staff and they complete setup by signing in with their personal Microsoft accounts, then later adding their work account; thus the majority of them are AAD-registered with no MDM authority, since of course we hadn't subscribed for Intune back then. That's why the goal is to eventually join them to AAD and enroll with Intune, so they can be brought back inline with the future fresh computers which have the benefit of Windows Autopilot to streamline that setup process. Obviously we want to carry out the change with as little disruption and pain as possible for our colleagues. So after much fiddling around different test cases with the Windows 10 clients + Azure AD + Intune, I think finally got a handle of what needs to be done. Starting point Computer AAD-registered, with Office 365/AAD user. No MDM authority. No entry in Intune (naturally). Finish point Computer AAD-joined, with Office 365/AAD user.

I've been comparing the different models and it seems to be between Hybrid AD Joined and Azure AD Joined. I've looked at the documentation from Microsoft and the Azure AD Joined option seems to be the best for our organization based on scenarios because we don't fit into any of the hybrid's bullet points (see below). Currently in Azure Active Directory > Devices the majority of devices display as Azure AD Registered and this is not the best solution for our organization. Due to covid our workforce has become remote and it's unlikely that the majority will return to the office. Devices are currently domain joined because we've been using an on-premise Active Directory. We also use Azure AD Connect to sync AD user objects with M365. Is there a way to convert / migrate devices from Azure AD Registered to Azure AD Joined? From my research the recommended solution is to retrieve the devices, reset them, and then set them up using Windows Auto Pilot. Can anyone else validate this or offer up different solutions? If there are different solutions to target remote workers so we can start managing their machines through Intune please let me know.

No user has access to them, they are encrypted at rest, no possibility of ransomware attacks affecting them. They are also replicated to other regions for protection. In addition, on an ongoing basis, the Azure SQL engineering team automatically tests the restore of automated database backups. (This testing is not currently available in SQL Managed Instance.) Upon point-in-time restore, databases also receive DBCC CHECKDB integrity checks. Any issues found during the integrity check will result in an alert to the engineering team. Furthermore, all database backups are taken with the CHECKSUM option to provide additional backup integrity. If the above does not make you satisfied to can implement your own backup schedule and store your bacpac files on Azure Immutable Blog Storage available since September 2018 as documented here.

For more information, please refer to the blog post, \u201c Immutable storage for Azure Storage Blobs now generally available .\u201d Financial Services organizations regulated by SEC, CFTC, FINRA, IIROC, FCA etc. are required to retain business-related communication in a Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) or immutable state that makes it non-erasable and non-modifiable for a certain retention interval. The immutable storage requirement is not limited to financial organizations, but also applies to industries such as healthcare, insurance, media, public safety, and legal services. Today, we are excited to announce the public preview of immutable storage for Azure Storage Blobs to address this requirement. The feature is available in all Azure public regions. Through configurable policies, users can keep Azure Blob storage data in an immutable state where Blobs can be created and read, but not modified or deleted. Typical applications include: Regulatory compliance: Immutable storage for Azure Blobs is designed to help financial institutions and related industries address SEC 17a-4(f), CFTC 1.31\u00a9-(d), FINRA etc. A technical whitepaper with details on how the feature addresses these regulatory requirements will be available soon. The Azure Trust Center contains detailed information about our compliance certifications. Secure document retention: Users receive maximum data protection as the immutable storage feature for Azure Blobs service ensures that data cannot be modified or deleted by any user including those with account administrative privileges. Legal hold: Immutable storage for Azure Storage Blobs enables users to store sensitive information critical to a litigation, criminal investigation, and more in a tamper-proof state for the desired duration. Immutable storage for Azure Storage Blobs enables: Time-based retention policy support: Users set policies to store data immutably for a specified interval of time. Legal hold policy support: When the retention interval is not known, users can set legal holds to store data immutably until the legal hold is cleared. Support for all Blob tiers: WORM policies are independent of the Azure Blob Storage tier and will apply to all the tiers, hot, cool and archive.

It would be better, though, if the solution worked with multiple cloud defenders. Currently, it can only be used with the Azure cloud. The WAF feature with Azure Application Gateway is extremely valuable to us. It is a key feature we were looking for in a traffic load balancer. Azure Application Gateway integrates well with other solutions and we have found it to be excellent at catching attacks and stopping suspicious content. It is a regional solution that has no limitations in terms of scalability. We would like to see the monitoring improved, with better reporting capabilities. We would also like to see Azure Application Gateway allow for better filtering on traffic protocols; sometimes traffic that should have been allowed access has been cut off due to strict security presets. If we could see everything that was going on in the system, it would make the security center in Azure Application Gateway much better. Conclusion: These two solutions are similarly effective in the services and features they provide. They both offer great pricing and outstanding support. There are even some scenarios where Azure Application Gateway should be deployed behind Azure Front Door. The major difference is that Azure Front Door is a global service and Azure Application Gateway is a regional service, so they have very different capabilities. We were looking for a regional solution to satisfy our client and we found the added WAF feature of the Azure Application Gateway a much-desired feature for our team and our clients with specific regional needs. We also found that Azure Application Gateway integrated better with more solutions and\n[2]: URL: https://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/tip/pick-a-load-balancer-azure-front-door-vs-application-gateway --- Title: Pick a load balancer: Azure Front Door vs. Application Gateway --- Body: Pick a load balancer: Azure Front Door vs. Application Gateway Getty Images Getty Images Tip Article 5 of 5 Part of: Choose the right Azure networking service Pick a load balancer: Azure Front Door vs. Application Gateway Every cloud infrastructure requires a solid network architecture and Azure has two load balancers that can improve network performance. Discover where each one will fit the best. By Chris Tozzi, Fixate IO Published: 05 Aug 2021 To get the most from a cloud computing architecture, it's imperative to underpin your infrastructure with the right networking management tools. Microsoft Azure includes an array of load balancing and network management tools, chief among them are Azure Front Door and Azure Application Gateway. Both tools essentially perform the same task but each is suited to a different purpose. And in some cases, they can be used simultaneously. What is Azure Front Door? Azure Front Door is a single global entry point which uses an edge network to create scalable web applications. The fully managed service can be configured as a load balancer for an application that runs on Azure. It operates at Open Systems Interconnection Layer 7, also known as the application layer. This means it manages network traffic related to application content. Some features that improve performance and reliability include the following: split TCP -based Anycast protocol for accelerated performance; back-end resource health probe monitoring; URL path-based routing; Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) offloading and certificate management; integrated Web Application Firewall (WAF); and end-to-end IPv6 connectivity and HTTP/2 protocol native support. How does load balancing work? What is Azure Application Gateway? Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer, also Layer 7, that manages application content traffic. Its setup process is similar to Azure Front Door. Users can create an Application Gateway, as well as a Front Door, using Azure Portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI and ARM templates. It also shares some features with Azure Front Door, such as session affinity and WAF integration. Some if its features to manage traffic include the following: SSL/TLS termination autoscaling zone redundancy static VIP URL-based routing multiple-site hosting WebSocket and HTTP/2 traffic native support What are the differences? While Front Door and Application Gateway can both manage Layer 7 traffic, Front Door is a global load balancer while Application Gateway is a regional load balancer. This means that Front Door is better suited in the following situations: You use\n[3]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/questions/301218/azure-waf-frontdoor-vs-azure-waf-application-gatew.html --- Title: Azure WAF frontdoor vs Azure WAF application gateway - Microsoft Q&A --- Body: Azure WAF frontdoor vs Azure WAF application gateway - Microsoft Q&A question 0 rk2007 asked \u2022 Mar 05 2021 at 8:59 AM|KALYANBRATADHAR-8648 commented \u2022 May 03 2021 at 8:26 PM Azure WAF frontdoor vs Azure WAF application gateway What is the key difference between gateway and frontdoor.

Since I'm part of the Azure Security Center team and this looks like a networking issue, I've removed the \"azure-security-center\" tag and have reached out to our Networking team to look into this issue. In the meantime, I was able to do some research on this and will post my colleague's answer below. Azure Front Door WAF and Azure App Gateway WAF are very similar in functionality, one of the main differences is where the WAF is applied. Azure Front Door applies the WAF filters at edge locations, way before it gets to the datacenter. App Gateway applies the filter when it enters your VNET via the App Gateway. Your best bet is to choose between the 2 in an application delivery perspective, and then apply whichever WAF you choose. If what you are using is inside of a VNET and inside a single region, App Gateway will be your best bet. For a multi-regional deployment or global route filtering, use Azure Front Door.

Or better said \u2026 What is the difference between the following services? Azure CDN vs Azure Front Door versus Azure Application Gateway (WAF) vs Azure Traffic Manager TL;DR If you do not want to go through the entire post, here is a brief summary of the different options ; My gut feeling tells me this will already help out like a lot! Web Application Firewall (WAF) : Azure Front Door vs Azure Application Gateway Both Azure Front Door and Azure Application Gatewa y state that they can be configured to act as a Web Application Firewall. They key difference here is that the Azure Application Gateway can do a \u201cdetection only\u201d-mode and that it supports CRS 2.2.9, 3.0, and 3.1. This means that there are out-of-the-box rules that provide a baseline security against most of the top-10 vulnerabilities that Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) identifies. With Azure Front Door, you need to configure the rules yourself to your liking. In terms of networking, there also is a very important difference between both. An Azure Application Gateway can be deployed (injected) in(to) an Azure VNET (Virtual Network). By doing so, the traffic between this gateway and your internal backend will flow through a private network. With Azure Front Door, your backend is always based on a public endpoint. Though you can harden / lock down the connectivity between Azure Front Door and your application by restricting the ingress of the traffic. Geographic Redundancy : Azure Front Door vs Azure Traffic Manager If you want to publish your webapp across regions, then you can leverage Azure Front Door or Azure Traffic Manager to do so. The most important thing to know is that Azure Traffic Manager is DNS based and serves as a redirection mechanism. Azure Front Door will serve as an entrypoint (think reverse proxy). So when using Traffic Manager, you will typically look\n[5]: URL: https://k21academy.com/microsoft-azure/az-303/azure-front-door-vs-application-gateway-vs-load-balancer --- Title: Azure Front Door vs Application Gateway vs Load Balancer --- Body: Azure Front Door vs Application Gateway vs Load Balancer Azure Front Door vs. Application Gateway vs. Load Balancer April 23, 2021 by Utkarsh Agarwal Agarwal Leave a Comment 6646 views In this Blog, we are going to discuss a Comparison of Microsoft Azure\u2019s provided Load Balancing Techniques.

While they serve similar purposes, there are some key differences between the two.\n\nAzure Front Door is a global service that acts as a single entry point for web applications, APIs, content, and cloud services. It operates at the application layer (Layer 7) and offers advanced features such as split TCP-based Anycast protocol, backend resource health probe monitoring, URL path-based routing, SSL offloading and certificate management, integrated Web Application Firewall (WAF), and support for IPv6 connectivity and HTTP/2 protocol [[2]](https://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/tip/pick-a-load-balancer-azure-front-door-vs-application-gateway). Azure Front Door provides a global infrastructure and can quickly detect abnormalities in traffic before it reaches the application. However, it can only be used with the Azure cloud and doesn't support integration with multiple cloud providers [[1]](https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/questions/301218/azure-waf-frontdoor-vs-azure-waf-application-gatew.html).\n\nOn the other hand, Azure Application Gateway is a regional load balancer that also operates at Layer 7. It manages application content traffic and offers features like SSL/TLS termination, autoscaling, zone redundancy, URL-based routing, multiple-site hosting, and support for WebSocket and HTTP/2 traffic. Azure Application Gateway integrates well with other solutions, has no scalability limitations, and provides excellent security against attacks and suspicious content [[1]](https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/questions/301218/azure-waf-frontdoor-vs-azure-waf-application-gatew.html).\n\nThe major difference between Azure Front Door and Azure Application Gateway is their scope and capabilities. Azure Front Door is a global service and is better suited for scenarios where you need to deploy a solution across multiple regions. It provides a global load balancing and routing mechanism while incorporating advanced features like Anycast protocol and IPv6 connectivity. On the other hand, Azure Application Gateway is a regional load balancer that excels at traffic management within a single region. It offers features like SSL/TLS termination and WAF integration, making it suitable for scenarios where you require a regional load balancing solution with enhanced security [[1]](https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/questions/301218/azure-waf-frontdoor-vs-azure-waf-application-gatew.html) [[2]](https://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/tip/pick-a-load-balancer-azure-front-door-vs-application-gateway).\n\nIn summary, Azure Front Door and Azure Application Gateway are both effective solutions for load balancing and traffic management, but their capabilities and scope differ.

For people who have never done a microsoft certification before or any other: You need to create a certification profile. This can be done by going to any exam page, clicking the order button and on the other page that it sends you to you can start filling out the information (needs to be accurate when you show your ID before testing). If you have any work accounts, I recommend connecting those there too because your employer might be in some special Microsoft programs that offer free vouchers or you might have to use a work account to attend an event and get the voucher sent there. This will also be a place where most of the vouchers Microsoft gives out go. You can familiarize yourself with the process of ordering certification until the process of checking out if you'd like.

Users can also create custom probes to mention the host name, the path to be probed, and the status codes to be accepted as Healthy. In each case, if the backend server doesn't respond successfully, Application Gateway marks the server as Unhealthy and stops forwarding requests to the server. After the server starts responding successfully, Application Gateway resumes forwarding the requests. How to check backend health To check the health of your backend pool, you can use the Backend Health page on the Azure portal. Or, you can use Azure PowerShell, CLI, or REST API. The status retrieved by any of these methods can be any one of the following: Healthy Unhealthy Unknown If the backend health status for a server is Healthy, it means that Application Gateway will forward the requests to that server. But if the backend health for all the servers in a backend pool is Unhealthy or unknown, you might encounter problems when you try to access applications. This article describes the symptoms, cause, and resolution for each of the errors shown. Backend health status: Unhealthy If the backend health status is Unhealthy, the portal view will resemble the following screenshot: Or if you're using an Azure PowerShell, CLI, or Azure REST API query, you'll get a response that resembles the following: Azure PowerShell Copy PS C:\\Users\\testuser\\> Get-AzApplicationGatewayBackendHealth -Name \"appgw1\" -ResourceGroupName \"rgOne\"BackendAddressPools : {Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Network.Models.PSApplicationGatewayBackendHealthPool} BackendAddressPoolsText : [ { \"BackendAddressPool\": { \"Id\": \"/subscriptions/536d30b8-665b-40fc-bd7e-68c65f816365/resourceGroups/rgOne/providers/Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways/appgw1/b ackendAddressPools/appGatewayBackendPool\"}, \"BackendHttpSettingsCollection\": [ { \"BackendHttpSettings\": { \"TrustedRootCertificates\": [], \"Id\": \"/subscriptions/536d30b8-665b-40fc-bd7e-68c65f816365/resourceGroups/rgOne/providers/Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways/appg w1/backendHttpSettingsCollection/appGatewayBackendHttpSettings\"}, \"Servers\": [ { \"Address\": \"10.0.0.5\", \"Health\": \"Healthy\"}, { \"Address\": \"10.0.0.6\", \"Health\": \"Unhealthy\"} ] } ] } ] After you receive an Unhealthy backend server status for all the servers in a backend pool, requests aren't forwarded to the servers, and Application Gateway returns a \"502 Bad Gateway\" error to the requesting client.

Explore other articles on this topic. Issue You see the error \"403 Access Forbidden by CSRFProtector!\" when logging in to an application protected by Duo Access Gateway (DAG). Resolution If you have multiple DAG servers configured behind a load balancer, ensure sticky sessions are enabled. If you do not have multiple DAG servers configured, clear the cache and cookies from the browser you are currently using. Cause CSRF Protector attempts to block cross-site request forgery (e.g. going to a website that posts a form to another site without a user's knowledge). In order to do this, a token has to be sent with each POST. That token is checked in the POST against a value in your user session. The reason this error occurs when you are attempting to load balance the DAGs is because when you bounce between the servers, they cannot see each other's session. If you do not have multiple DAG servers configured, this issue can occur if browser updates or changes are made in the middle of a DAG session.\n", "messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!

Published Oct 7, 2021 + Follow ExpressRoute provides direct connectivity to Azure cloud services and connecting Microsoft\u2019s global network. All transferred data is not encrypted, and do not go over the public Internet. VPN Gateway provides secured connectivity to Azure cloud services over public Internet. All transferred data is encrypted in a private tunnel as it crosses the internet. Azure ExpressRoute ExpressRoute connections use a private, dedicated connection through a third-party connectivity provider to provide a direct connection between on-premises network and Azure. This architecture is suitable for hybrid applications running large-scale, mission-critical workloads that require a high degree of scalability and resiliency. Key Points \u00b7 ExpressRoute uses layer 3 connectivity and security standards. \u00b7 ExpressRoute connects the edge router of the on-premise network and Azure infrastructure with redundancy capabilities. \u00b7 ExpressRoute provides dynamic scalability to help meet organizational needs (from 50 Mbps to 10 Gbps). Benefits \u00b7 Much higher bandwidth available (up to 10 Gbps). \u00b7 Supports dynamic scaling of bandwidth to help reduce costs during periods of lower demand. \u00b7 99.9% availability SLA across the entire connection. Considerations \u00b7 The setup and configuration for ExpressRoute is more complex, and will require collaboration with the connectivity provider. \u00b7 ExpressRoute requires the on-premises installation of high-bandwidth routers. \u00b7 ExpressRoute circuit is handled and managed by the connectivity provider. \u00b7 ExpressRoute doesn\u2019t support the Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP). You\u2019ll need to enable a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) configuration. Azure VPN Gateway VPN gateway allows you to connect on-premises network to Azure networks to send traffic over public Internet and uses an encrypted tunnel. This architecture is suitable for hybrid applications where the traffic between on-premises hardware and the cloud is likely to be light, or you are willing to trade slightly extended latency for the flexibility and processing power of the cloud. Key Points \u00b7 Gateway Routing of VPN gateways is based on Dynamic and static routing. \u00b7 It supports Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol, IP Sec protocol. Benefits \u00b7 Easy to configure. \u00b7 Much higher bandwidth available (up to 10 Gbps depending on the VPN Gateway SKU) Considerations \u00b7 Requires an on-premises VPN device. \u00b7 Although Microsoft guarantees 99.9% availability for each VPN Gateway, this\n[3]: URL: https://techtarget.com/searchwindowsserver/definition/microsoft-azure-expressroute --- Title: What is Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute? - Definition from ... --- Body: What is Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute? - Definition from WhatIs.com Home IT operations and infrastructure management Cloud computing Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute Definition Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute By Crystal Bedell Tayla Holman, Site Editor Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute is a service that provides a private connection between an organization's on-premises infrastructure and Microsoft Azure data centers. Azure ExpressRoute requires a valid and active Azure account. ExpressRoute customers must either have an existing relationship with a supported connectivity provider or connect to Microsoft cloud services through an exchange if the desired connectivity provider is not supported. History Microsoft announced the general availability of Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute on May 12, 2014 at TechEd North America. At that time, the cloud service provider offered circuit bandwidths from 200 Mbps to 10 Gbps. ExpressRoute was available to customers in the United States and Europe via three locations: California, Washington D.C. and London. ExpressRoute customers could connect to Azure services as well as virtual machines and cloud services deployed in virtual networks. On July 21, 2014, Microsoft announced the availability of an additional seven ExpressRoute locations. In the US, those locations were Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, New York and Seattle. In Asia, those locations were Hong Kong and Singapore. By March 2015, Microsoft had made ExpressRoute available across 16 locations globally. Its partner network had grown to 20 partners. In addition, Microsoft announced the ability to access Office 365 via ExpressRoute. In February 2018, Microsoft announced the general availability of ExpressRoute monitoring with Network Performance Monitor (NPM). NPM allows ExpressRoute customers to monitor end-to-end connectivity and performance between their branch offices and Azure. In April 2019, Microsoft announced the availability of ExpressRoute Direct and Global Reach. ExpressRoute Direct provides 100 Gbps connectivity, enabling customers to push more data to Azure. ExpressRoute Global Reach extends the use of ExpressRoute from on-premises to Azure to also provide connectivity between on-premises sites using the Microsoft Global Network. As of this writing, Microsoft has more than 40 ExpressRoute locations. Key Features Microsoft ExpressRoute offers the following features: Redundancy. Each ExpressRoute circuit consists of two connections to two Microsoft Enterprise edge routers from the connectivity provider or customer\u2019s network edge. Connectivity to Microsoft cloud services. Customers can access Microsoft Azure services, Microsoft Office 365 services and Microsoft Dynamics 365 via ExpressRoute. Connectivity to geopolitical regions. Customers can connect to Microsoft in one of the provider\u2019s peering locations and access regions within the geopolitical region.

Reference: Microsoft TL;DR ExpressRoute provides direct connectivity to Azure cloud services and connecting Microsoft\u2019s global network. All transferred data is not encrypted, and do not go over the public Internet. VPN Gateway provides secured connectivity to Azure cloud services over public Internet. All transferred data is encrypted in a private tunnel as it crosses the internet. Azure ExpressRoute Azure ExpressRoute ExpressRoute connections use a private, dedicated connection through a third-party connectivity provider to provide a direct connection between on-premises network and Azure. This architecture is suitable for hybrid applications running large-scale, mission-critical workloads that require a high degree of scalability and resiliency. Key Points ExpressRoute uses layer 3 connectivity and security standards. ExpressRoute connects the edge router of the on-premise network and Azure infrastructure with redundancy capabilities. ExpressRoute provides dynamic scalability to help meet organizational needs (from 50 Mbps to 10 Gbps). Benefits Much higher bandwidth available (up to 10 Gbps). Supports dynamic scaling of bandwidth to help reduce costs during periods of lower demand. 99.9% availability SLA across the entire connection. Considerations The setup and configuration for ExpressRoute is more complex, and will require collaboration with the connectivity provider. ExpressRoute requires the on-premises installation of high-bandwidth routers. ExpressRoute circuit is handled and managed by the connectivity provider. ExpressRoute doesn\u2019t support the Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP). You\u2019ll need to enable a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) configuration. Azure VPN Gateway Azure VPN Gateway VPN gateway allows you to connect on-premises network to Azure networks to send traffic over public Internet and uses an encrypted tunnel. This architecture is suitable for hybrid applications where the traffic between on-premises hardware and the cloud is likely to be light, or you are willing to trade slightly extended latency for the flexibility and processing power of the cloud. Key Points Gateway Routing of VPN gateways is based on Dynamic and static routing. It supports Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol, IP Sec protocol. Benefits Easy to configure. Much higher bandwidth available (up to 10 Gbps depending on the VPN Gateway SKU) Considerations Requires an on-premises VPN device. Although Microsoft guarantees 99.9% availability for each VPN\n", "messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!

I can assign users and AD groups to those roles. However, when I want to assign a group to a role, it works only when a user is a direct member of the group. If, for instance, I add the whole group STUD to a role, it does not work with role assignment. Therefore I have to add all the single nested roles to the role, which is quite time consuming. But that would have been acceptable as one-time-solution. Bad thing is, there are new groups and users constantly. And I'd have to keep the role assignments up-to-date manually all the time.

Question Can we use a nested Azure AD group for assigning Intune Application Protection (AKA MAM-WE) policies? Answer Short version: Yes, but give it a little thought first Long version: I was asked this one recently and I wasn\u2019t certain but thought it would most likely work. I set up an example where I had an on-premises Active Directory user named PeterOP, I added that user to an on-premises Active Directory security group which was then synchronised to Azure Active Directory with Azure AD Connect. The AD group was called MyAPPTest. I then added that group to an Azure AD group called Android App Protection as you can see in the image. So we have an on-prem user inside an on-prem AD group which is nested inside an Azure AD group. The App Protection policy is then assigned to the AAD group \u2013 Android App Protection Then I simply test by opening an application which is protected by this policy, in this case on a personal device. Then I log in as PeterOP \u2013 my on-premises AD user. On the device I see the regular prompts about the app being protected etc and it just works fine. We can see this in the report through the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center. Note that I only actually tried Word and Outlook in this test as that sufficiently confirmed my test result. Should we use this though? Great question, I\u2019m glad you asked :). We can see that although it does work, it may become somewhat convoluted and complicated as this scales out across a real-world organisation. I\u2019m just using a simple targeted demo here and there\u2019s a level of comprehension required to keep up with the nesting. With that in mind I\u2019d generally try and steer you away from using nested groups in this scenario and indeed others for this reason. Note however, that although this works for App Protection I can\u2019t say it will work for all features as I know that nested groups are not supported in all areas of Azure Active Directory or Intune/Endpoint Manager. In particular, group-based licensing often comes up as a requirement and\n[5]: URL: https://community.zscaler.com/t/azure-ad-nested-group-not-synced-in-zscaler-group/9092 --- Title: \ue000Azure\ue001 \ue000AD Nested Group not synced in ZScaler group\ue001 - Zenith --- Body: Azure AD Nested Group not synced in ZScaler group - Authentication - Zenith Azure AD Nested Group not synced in ZScaler group Authentication user-group mahesh_kulkarni(mahesh kulkarni) October 2, 2020, 2:24pm #1 In ZScaler ZSCloud, SAML is used for authentication users with Azure AD as IdP.

It offers a range of features to help organizations manage and secure user identities and control access to resources. Some key features of Azure AD include:\n\n1. Single Sign-On (SSO): Azure AD enables users to sign in once and access multiple applications and resources without the need to enter credentials again. This improves user productivity and reduces the burden of remembering multiple passwords.\n\n2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Azure AD supports various MFA methods, including phone calls, text messages, mobile app notifications, and biometric factors. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide additional proof of their identity during sign-in.\n\n3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Azure AD allows organizations to define granular access permissions based on roles. This helps ensure that users have access only to the resources necessary for their job responsibilities, improving security and compliance.\n\n4. Application and User Management: Azure AD provides tools for managing applications and users in a centralized manner. Administrators can easily provision and deprovision user accounts, assign and revoke application access, and enforce access policies.\n\n5. Self-Service Password Reset: Azure AD allows users to reset their passwords without the need to contact IT support. This saves time and improves user productivity.\n\n6. Azure AD Join: Azure AD Join enables users to join their devices to an Azure AD domain, allowing organizations to manage device authentication and access control. This simplifies device management and enhances security.\n\n7. Integration with Azure Services: Azure AD integrates with other Azure services, such as Azure Virtual Machines, Azure App Service, and Azure SQL Database, providing seamless authentication and authorization capabilities.\n\nThese are just a few of the many features offered by Azure AD. It is a comprehensive identity management solution that helps organizations secure their resources, streamline access management, and enhance user productivity.\n\nIs there anything else you would like to know about Azure AD?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "explain the process of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security measure that adds an extra layer of protection to user sign-ins and access control. It requires users to provide multiple forms of verification to prove their identity during the authentication process. Here is a general overview of the MFA process in Azure AD:\n\n1. Enabling MFA: Administrators can enable MFA for users in the Azure AD portal or through Azure AD PowerShell commands. This enables MFA for the selected users and allows them to set up additional verification methods.\n\n2. User Sign-In: When a user attempts to sign in to a resource or application, they enter their username and password as usual.\n\n3. MFA Prompt: After entering their credentials, the user is prompted to perform additional verification steps. The specific verification methods available will depend on the MFA configuration set by the administrator. Examples of verification methods include phone calls, text messages with verification codes, mobile app notifications, or biometric factors like facial recognition or fingerprint scans.\n\n4. User Verification: The user follows the prompts to complete the verification process. This may involve entering a verification code received via phone call or text message, approving a notification in a mobile app, or providing a fingerprint or other biometric data.\n\n5. Access Granted: If the user successfully completes the MFA process, they are granted access to the desired resource or application. If the verification is not successful, access is denied.\n\nMFA can significantly enhance the security of user accounts by providing an additional layer of protection against unauthorized access, even if the user's password is compromised. It is an effective way to mitigate risks associated with password-based authentication.\n\nPlease note that the specific steps and options for MFA may vary depending on the configuration and policies set by the organization's administrators. It is recommended to consult Azure AD documentation or seek assistance from your IT department for detailed instructions on setting up and managing MFA in your Azure AD environment."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what is the benefit of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides several benefits for organizations in terms of security and user authentication. Here are some key benefits:\n\n1. Enhanced Security: MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide multiple factors of authentication. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if a user's password is compromised. Attackers would need additional verification factors, such as a physical device or biometric data, to gain access.\n\n2. Protection Against Password-related Threats: Password-related threats, such as phishing attacks or credential stuffing, are common methods used by attackers to gain unauthorized access. MFA helps mitigate these threats because even if an attacker obtains a user's password, they would still require the additional verification factors to complete the authentication process.\n\n3. Compliance with Industry Standards and Regulations: Many industry standards and regulations, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), require organizations to implement strong authentication measures. MFA helps organizations meet these compliance requirements by providing an additional layer of protection.\n\n4. Simplified User Experience: MFA solutions often offer user-friendly options for verification, such as mobile apps or biometric factors like facial recognition or fingerprint scans. This improves the user experience compared to traditional password-based authentication methods, as users do not need to remember complex passwords or frequently change them.\n\n5. Flexibility and Adaptability: MFA solutions can be configured to meet the specific needs of an organization. Administrators can choose from various verification methods and configure policies based on user roles or specific applications. This flexibility allows organizations to adapt their authentication processes to different scenarios and user requirements.\n\n6. Remote Access Security: With the rise of remote work, it is crucial to ensure secure access to corporate resources from outside the traditional network perimeter. MFA provides an additional layer of protection for remote access scenarios by adding an extra verification step beyond username and password.\n\nOverall, MFA is a highly effective security measure that helps prevent unauthorized access, protect sensitive data, and meet compliance requirements.

In this article, you learn how to: Prepare Azure VMs. Create a vault. Discover VMs and configure a backup policy. Enable backup for Azure VMs. Run the initial backup. Note This article describes how to set up a vault and select VMs to back up. It's useful if you want to back up multiple VMs. Alternatively, you can back up a single Azure VM directly from the VM settings. Before you start Review the Azure VM backup architecture. Learn about Azure VM backup, and the backup extension. Review the support matrix before you configure backup. In addition, there are a couple of things that you might need to do in some circumstances: Install the VM agent on the VM: Azure Backup backs up Azure VMs by installing an extension to the Azure VM agent running on the machine. If your VM was created from an Azure Marketplace image, the agent is installed and running. If you create a custom VM, or you migrate an on-premises machine, you might need to install the agent manually.

One of the ways I\u2019ve leveraged Blob Storage is with SQL Server backups. I even wrote a Sync and Restore command-line toolset to keep files and folders in sync between an on-premises file system and Blob Storage, because the tool provided by Microsoft, AzCopy, was just not up to the task. As I wrote in a previous post, there were two main issues with AzCopy. The first was that the journal could get corrupted, and the /y switch to resume or overwrite the copy process was not consistent enough to be reliable. The second issue was that there was no analogue to RoboCopy\u2019s /mir switch. To refresh your memory, RoboCopy (Robust Copy for Windows, built into Windows for a number of years) allows us to keep folders in sync between a source and destination using the mirror switch /mir. In other words, if there are any changes to the source, these changes will be propagated to the destination. Files that no longer exist in the source will be deleted in the destination automatically. For managing file archives, this is hugely beneficial to help manage storage costs. In the case of AzCopy, deleting files in the destination that were no longer in the source was fairly difficult to manage (hence my Sync tool above). As of November 2018 however, the v10 preview of AzCopy is vastly improved. Firstly, it runs cross-platform on Windows, Linux and macOS (it is open-source, and appears to be written in Go ). Secondly, it has more sensible command-line switches. Thirdly, and most importantly in my mind, it includes the much-awaited sync option. This has been a long time coming. To synchronize a folder between on-premises (local) and off-site (Azure Blob Storage), we can issue a command like this: azcopy sync \"Z:\\SQLData\\Backup\\INSTANCE\" \"https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/INSTANCE?sastoken\" --recursive --force The parameters for sync are as follows: the sync keyword, followed by the source folder Z:\\SQLData\\Backup\\INSTANCE (escaped with quotation marks) the destination container https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/INSTANCE?sastoken (escaped with quotation marks) the --recursive switch, which tells azcopy to copy the entire structure below the source folder the --force switch, which will override\n", "messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!

There have been several discussions and concerns raised by users regarding the inability of AzCopy to overwrite destination files in certain scenarios.\n\nOne issue mentioned on GitHub [[1]](https://github.com/azure/azure-storage-azcopy/issues/260) highlights the challenge of overwriting newer files on the destination. AzCopy does not reliably get any hash over the entire blob, making it difficult to determine if a file on the destination is newer than the source. Additionally, setting reliable Last Modified Times (LMTs) during blob uploads is also challenging.\n\nAnother GitHub issue [[3]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-ref-azcopy) mentions that overwriting files using the \"ifSourceNewer\" option does not work for File Shares, indicating a limitation in AzCopy's functionality.\n\nIn cases where AzCopy fails to transfer files, one Stack Overflow post [[4]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/191209/how-to-say-no-to-all-do-you-want-to-overwrite-prompts-in-a-batch-file-copy) suggests implementing a retry mechanism to handle failed file transfers. It recommends using a script to iterate through the failed files and retry uploading them automatically.\n\nIt's important to note that AzCopy has undergone improvements over time. An article on Born SQL [[5]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-ref-azcopy-remove) highlights the addition of the \"sync\" option in the v10 preview of AzCopy. This new option allows users to synchronize a folder between a local source and Azure Blob Storage, providing a better file synchronization experience compared to the previous versions of AzCopy.\n\nIf you are experiencing specific issues with AzCopy, it is recommended to consult the Azure documentation and Azure community forums for further guidance or reach out to Azure support for assistance."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you elaborate with more examples."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! Here are some more examples related to the issues faced with azcopy:\n\n1. Overwriting newer files on the destination: Imagine you have a static destination that does not change and a dynamic destination container that has the possibility of changing. In this scenario, it becomes challenging for AzCopy to reliably determine if a file on the destination is newer than the source [[1]](https://github.com/azure/azure-storage-azcopy/issues/260).\n\n2.

This limitation can impact your file transfer operations.\n\n3. Handling failed file transfers: If you encounter situations where AzCopy fails to transfer certain files, it is important to handle these failures and retry the upload automatically. In one instance, a Stack Overflow post suggests implementing a retry mechanism using a script [[4]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/191209/how-to-say-no-to-all-do-you-want-to-overwrite-prompts-in-a-batch-file-copy).

Discussion Options Dai_Webb Occasional Contributor \u200eMay 20 2021 12:10 AM How do I change the date format in all areas of Azure DevOps web interface? Hello. I'm fairly new to Azure DevOps and I've just started setting up some projects ready to migrate away from JIRA. However, something I cannot figure out is how to change the date formats in the DevOps web interface. We are in the UK and want UK format dates everywhere (dd/mm/yyyy). I have found that I can change this in my User Settings but it hasn't changed what I see in various screens. For example, dashboard widgets still show American dates. Burndown Trends still show American dates. This is really frustrating. How do I configure UK dates for all areas for all users? All of our projects will be the same, we will never ever use American dates. I've gone through project settings and organisation settings but can't find it anywhere, and Googling returned nothing useful. Thanks in advance.

We\u2019re now at a stage where half of organizations contend the cloud is more secure than their on-premises infrastructure. In conversations I have with our customers and partners, I hear increasingly about how using the cloud improves an organizations\u2019 security posture. As many organizations push forward on their digital transformation through increased use of cloud services, understanding the current state of cloud security is essential. Maintaining a strong security posture for your cloud-based innovation is a shared responsibility between you and your cloud provider. With Microsoft Azure, securing cloud resources is a partnership between Microsoft and our customers, so it\u2019s essential that you understand the comprehensive set of security controls and capabilities available to you on Azure. Microsoft Azure is built on a foundation of trust and security. With significant investments in security, compliance, privacy, and transparency, Azure provides a secure foundation to host your infrastructure, applications, and data in the cloud. Microsoft also provides built-in security controls and capabilities to further help you protect your data and applications on Azure. These can be classified broadly into four categories: Manage and control user identity and access: Comprehensive identity management is the linchpin of any secure system. You must ensure that only authorized users can access your environments, data, and applications. Azure Active Directory serves as a central system for managing access across all your cloud services, including Azure, Office 365, and hundreds of popular SaaS and PaaS cloud services. Its federation capability means that you can use your on-premises identities and credentials to access those services, and Azure Multi-Factor Authentication provides for the most secure sign-on experience. Increase network and infrastructure security: Azure provides you the security-hardened infrastructure to interconnect Azure VMs as well as make connections to on-premises datacenters. Additionally, you can extend your on-premises network to the cloud using secure site-to-site VPN or a dedicated Azure ExpressRoute connection. You can strengthen network security by configuring Network Security Groups, user-defined routing, IP forwarding, forced tunneling, endpoint ACLs, and Web Application Firewall as appropriate.

That someone used my VM for some malicious activity, and brute forced into it, or used it to brute force somewhere else? I'm pretty sure no one had access to my Ubuntu Azure VM since last password change. It was said that all this may result in suspension of my deployment.

Written by Mary Jo Foley, Contributor Posted in All About Microsoft on December 12, 2019| Topic: Windows 10 Microsoft Azure EVP Jason Zander Almost two years ago -- in March 2018 -- Microsoft reorganized its Windows business simultaneously with the departure of former Windows and Devices chief Terry Myerson. Organizationally, the company split Windows in two, with half the team moving into the Azure organization and the other half going to Experiences & Devices (E&D). The split basically was along the lines of the Windows stack, with the core of Windows going to Azure and the front-end UX going to E&D. Since then, Microsoft has said very little publicly about what that move has meant to how Windows is built and maintained across the various platforms it supports . But this week, I had a chance to talk to Azure Executive Vice President Jason Zander about how he's looking at his world now that it includes Windows engineering. (This post doesn't cover what's going on with the UX side of Windows which, organizationally, is in Executive Vice President Rajesh Jha's organization. Nor does it touch on the Essential Products Group (EPIC) work happening under Corporate Vice President Joe Belfiore. Belfiore oversees the Windows shell/user experience work, plus Microsoft Edge, News, OneNote, Education products, mobile apps and services on Android and iOS.) Zander, who has been with Microsoft since 1992, leads the core teams working on Microsoft's intelligent cloud and intelligent edge products and services. He is in charge of Azure strategy, product management, engineering and operations of Microsoft's cloud product lines, SQL Server, big data and analytics, quantum computing and more. As part of his purview, Zander also is in charge of COSINE, Microsoft's Core Operating System and Intelligent Edge team. (Microsoft does not share org charts, but I believe COSINE is run by Corporate Vice President Roanne Sones on the PM/platforms side and Corporate Vice President Michael Fortin on the dev side.) COSINE includes the former Windows and Devices Group (WDG) team, but it is more than just Windows engineering, as its name reflects. It also includes Microsoft engineers working on Linux, Windows Server and Azure, Zander said. \"We have some\n[5]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/integrations/boards-teams --- Title: Use Azure Boards with Microsoft Teams - Azure Boards ... --- Body: Use Azure Boards with Microsoft Teams - Azure Boards | Microsoft Docs Azure DevOps Azure Boards Integrations & extensions Use the Azure Boards app in Microsoft Teams Article 04/29/2022 9 minutes to read 13 contributors In this article Prerequisites Add the Azure Boards app to Microsoft Teams Link your Azure Boards project to the Azure Boards app Set up subscriptions Add area paths Create a work item with a command Create a work item from message actions Manage Azure Boards subscriptions Search and share work items using compose extension Preview work item URLs Unlink a project from a channel Threaded notifications to link and reduce notifications Azure Boards command reference Configure Azure DevOps Services tabs in Microsoft Teams Multi-tenant support Troubleshoot errors Related articles Azure DevOps Services If you use Microsoft Teams, you can create work items and monitor work item activity in your Azure Boards project from your Teams channel.

It leverages threat intelligence, monitoring, and advanced analytics to detect and mitigate potential threats in IoT devices, applications, and networks.\n\nThe system utilizes machine learning, behavioral analytics, and application-based intelligence to analyze data from various sources, including billions of web pages, emails, Windows device updates, and monthly authentications. This vast amount of data is processed in Microsoft's Intelligent Security Graph, which provides actionable insights and real-time global cybersecurity intelligence.\n\nBy analyzing patterns, anomalies, and known attack vectors, the system can identify potential security risks and threats in IoT deployments. It can detect suspicious behavior, unauthorized access attempts, malware infections, and other indicators of compromise that could compromise the security of IoT systems.\n\nWith these insights, organizations using Azure for IoT can take proactive measures to mitigate risks, such as implementing security patches, updating firmware, configuring access controls, and implementing security best practices. The goal is to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of IoT systems and protect against evolving threats [[3]](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/overview/security).\n\nIt's important to note that security is a shared responsibility between Microsoft and customers, and organizations should also follow security best practices and implement appropriate security measures at their end to further enhance the security of their IoT deployments [[1]](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/safeguarding-your-cloud-resources-with-azure-security-services)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What do we mean by forced tunneling in terms of Azure network security ?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Forced tunneling is a network security feature in Azure that allows organizations to redirect all internet-bound traffic from Azure virtual networks through their on-premises network infrastructure. It can be useful in scenarios where organizations require centralized control and inspection of all outgoing traffic from their virtual networks.\n\nBy enabling forced tunneling, organizations can ensure that all internet traffic from Azure virtual networks passes through their on-premises security appliances, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, or web gateways. This allows them to apply consistent security policies and perform deep inspection of the traffic before it reaches the internet.\n\nForced tunneling is achieved by configuring a user-defined route in Azure that directs all internet-bound traffic to a specific on-premises network gateway or service. This route takes precedence over the default route in Azure, ensuring that traffic is forced to go through the designated on-premises infrastructure.\n\nIt's important to note that forced tunneling may add latency to internet-bound traffic as it goes through the on-premises network infrastructure. Organizations should carefully plan and test their network architecture to ensure optimal performance and scalability.\n\nBy utilizing forced tunneling, organizations can implement additional security controls and monitoring for all internet-bound traffic from their Azure virtual networks, helping to protect their resources and data in the cloud [[[1]](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/safeguarding-your-cloud-resources-with-azure-security-services)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/safeguarding-your-cloud-resources-with-azure-security-services)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What do we mean by Endpoint ACL in terms of Azure Network Security ?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Endpoint ACL in terms of Azure Network Security refers to the Endpoint Access Control List feature available in Azure. An Access Control List (ACL) is a set of rules that define the permissions and restrictions for network traffic. Endpoint ACLs, specifically, allow you to control network traffic to and from endpoints in Azure, such as virtual machines (VMs), by specifying network traffic filters and rules.\n\nWith Endpoint ACLs, you can define rules that allow or deny specific types of traffic based on various parameters such as source IP address, destination IP address, source port, destination port, and protocol. This granular control helps you enforce network security policies and restrict access to and from your endpoints, providing an additional layer of protection for your Azure resources.\n\nEndpoint ACLs are managed at the subnet level in Azure, meaning you can apply them to specific subnets containing your VMs or other endpoints. This allows you to tailor the network traffic rules to different parts of your network infrastructure as needed.\n\nBy configuring Endpoint ACLs, you can regulate inbound and outbound traffic to your endpoints, prevent unauthorized access, and mitigate the risk of network-based attacks. It's important to carefully plan and define your ACL rules to ensure they align with your security requirements and allow legitimate traffic while blocking unauthorized or malicious traffic.\n\nEndpoint ACLs are just one of the many network security features available in Azure, allowing you to customize and strengthen the security posture of your virtual networks and protect your resources and data in the cloud [[[1]](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/safeguarding-your-cloud-resources-with-azure-security-services)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/safeguarding-your-cloud-resources-with-azure-security-services)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thank you for the information "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You're welcome!

If you signed up for Azure through a Microsoft representative, then your default payment method is already be set to check or wire transfer. If you switch to pay by check or wire transfer, that means you pay your bill within 30 days of the invoice date by check/wire transfer. When you request to change your payment method to check/wire transfer, there are two possible results: You're automatically approved and you're prompted for information about your company. You're not automatically approved, but you can submit a request to Azure support. Users with a Microsoft Customer Agreement must always submit a request to Azure support to enable pay by check or wire transfer. Important Pay by check or wire transfer is only available for customers using Azure on behalf of a company. Pay all outstanding charges before switching to pay by by check or wire transfer. An outstanding invoice is paid by your default payment method. In order to have it paid by check or wire transfer, you must change your default payment method to check or wire transfer after you've been approved.

If you're an Azure customer with an Enterprise Agreement (EA customer), you can't download your organization's invoice. Instead, invoices are sent to the person set to receive invoices for the enrollment. When invoices are generated An invoice is generated based on your billing account type. Invoices are created for Microsoft Online Service Program (MOSP), Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA), and Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA) billing accounts. Invoices are also generated for Enterprise Agreement (EA) billing accounts. However, invoices for EA billing accounts aren't shown in the Azure portal. To learn more about billing accounts and identify your billing account type, see View billing accounts in Azure portal. Invoice status When you review your invoice status in the Azure portal, each invoice has one of the following status symbols. Status symbol Description Due is displayed when an invoice is generated, but it hasn't been paid yet. Past due is displayed when Azure tried to charge your payment method, but the payment was declined. Paid status is displayed when Azure has successfully charged your payment method.

Caution Misconfiguration of a block policy can lead to organizations being locked out of the Azure portal. Policies like these can have unintended side effects. Proper testing and validation are vital before enabling. Administrators should utilize tools such as Conditional Access report-only mode and the What If tool in Conditional Access when making changes. User exclusions Conditional Access policies are powerful tools, we recommend excluding the following accounts from your policy: Emergency access or break-glass accounts to prevent tenant-wide account lockout. In the unlikely scenario all administrators are locked out of your tenant, your emergency-access administrative account can be used to log into the tenant take steps to recover access. More information can be found in the article, Manage emergency access accounts in Azure AD. Service accounts and service principals, such as the Azure AD Connect Sync Account. Service accounts are non-interactive accounts that are not tied to any particular user. They are normally used by back-end services allowing programmatic access to applications, but are also used to sign in to systems for administrative purposes. Service accounts like these should be excluded since MFA can't be completed programmatically. Calls made by service principals are not blocked by Conditional Access. If your organization has these accounts in use in scripts or code, consider replacing them with managed identities. As a temporary workaround, you can exclude these specific accounts from the baseline policy. Create a Conditional Access policy The following steps will help create Conditional Access policies to block access to all apps except for Office 365 if users are not on a trusted network. These policies are put in to Report-only mode to start so administrators can determine the impact they will have on existing users. When administrators are comfortable that the policies apply as they intend, they can switch them to On. The first policy blocks access to all apps except for Microsoft 365 applications if not on a trusted location.

Francis In order to manage Azure AD, we use Azure Active Directory option in https://portal.azure.com. By default, any user under Azure AD can access this option event they do not have a Directory role. In my demo setup, I have a user called \"Emily Braun\". She doesn't have any Directory role assigned. Then I log in to Azure portal https://portal.azure.com as the user and then go to A zure Active Directory option. It didn't block me accessing it. I can go to All users and see user account details. I even can see the Groups memberships details. Also, can view application assignments. As an end user I also can see the Azure AD Connect details. Even though it doesn't allow me to change the user settings, it still allows me to see the current settings. I also can see the directory properties. I agree it doesn't allow to change settings but I am not comfortable with disclosing the above info to a standard user. Microsoft allows restricting standard user access to Azure Active Directory administration portal. Let's see how we can do that. 1. Log in to Azure portal as Global Administrator 2.

You only want administrators to have access and restrict users to access Azure portal. It\u2019s not relevant for standard users to have access. Is there a way to disable user access to the Azure AD portal? Yes, there is. In this article, we will look at how to restrict access to Azure AD administration portal. Table of contents User access to Azure AD administration portal Restrict access to Azure AD administration portal Verify no access to Azure AD administration portal Conclusion User access to Azure AD administration portal Sign in to Azure portal as a user. In our example, we will sign in as the user Alison Bell. Click on Menu > Azure Active Directory. In the Overview screen, the user can see the Azure Active Directory information. Click in the menu on Users and Groups. In the All users section, all the users are visible to the user. Also, all the groups are visible to the user. Click in the menu on Roles and administrators. Verify the role of the user. In our case, it\u2019s the role User. Click on Your Role. The user does not have directory roles assigned. In the next step, we will look at restricting users from accessing the Azure AD administration portal. Restrict access to Azure AD administration portal Sign in to Azure portal as a Global Administrator. Click on the Menu and select Azure Active Directory. Click in the menu on User settings. Click under Administration portal > Restrict access to Azure AD administration portal on Yes. Click Save. Setting the option Restrict access to Azure AD administration portal to Yes restricts all non-administrators from accessing any Azure AD data in the administration portal. You may need to give the setting a couple of minutes to apply the changes.

API Gateways Security What's the difference between an API proxy vs. API gateway? And which one should you use? In this blog, we demystify: What an API proxy is. Key differences between an API proxy vs. API gateway. Why an API gateway is better than an API proxy. What Is an API Proxy? An API proxy acts as a gateway between your developers and backend services, although it is limited in its capabilities when compared to an API gateway. It's an intermediary that makes requests on behalf of developers, sitting between application and backend services. An API gateway provides more features including rate limiting, security, and API monitoring. What this means to us in the API world, is that when you\u2019re using an API proxy, your API had better already exist. An API proxy provides a new endpoint for an existing API, but it can't do everything an API gateway can do. API Proxy vs. API Gateway: What's the Difference? Both an API proxy and API gateway provide access to your backend services. An API gateway can even act as a simple API proxy. However, an API gateway has a more robust set of features \u2014 especially around security and monitoring \u2014 than an API proxy . Should I Use an API Proxy? An API proxy is basically a lightweight API gateway. It includes some basic security and monitoring capabilities. So, if you already have an API and your needs are simple, an API proxy will work fine. But there's only so much an API proxy can do. It really can\u2019t do anything particularly sophisticated with content or routing. And it definitely can't do transformation, mediation, or orchestration . Enterprise API Management, Defined API proxies and API gateways are critical in enterprise API management \u2014 and digital transformation. In this white paper, you'll learn how to leverage enterprise API management to drive your digital-first initiative forward. \ud83d\udcd5 Get the White Paper Should I Use an API Gateway? The short answer is yes. An API gateway provides a single entry point across multiple APIs. It delivers robust security, including rate limiting. And it can even be used with external consumers in support of microservices and to secure the microservices mesh.

Just joined as Reddit now appears to be the best place to hang out for community support. So I've got an \"internal\" application with an HTML front end. It uses AD for authentication - I think Kerberos, but haven't had that confirmed yet. I want this app to be publicly accessible. So my two options are to put it behind either an Application Gateway or Application Proxy, but I'm struggling to decide which is the most appropriate. I've never implemented App Proxy, so I think I'm probably missing what differentiates it from App Gateway. What are the features and capabilities that drive the use cases for these two options? 3 comments 100% Upvoted Log in or sign up to leave a comment Log In Sign Up Sort by: best level 1 Flashcat666 \u00b7 1 yr. ago Application gateway is used for layer 7 load balancing, whereas your application proxy is used to proxy requests to an internal backend. Your use case is more appropriate for an application proxy, unless your backend needs to be load balanced, in which case I would suggest either having a public app gateway OR setting up a site-to-site VPN Gateway between Azure and your local network, and using an app gateway with a private IP so it would only be accessible via the VPN tunnel/your internal network. 1 level 2 InitializedVariable \u00b7 1 yr. ago Yup. Application Gateways are mainly meant to protect your applications and handle incoming requests. They\u2019re basically WAFs with some load balancing capabilities. Application Proxies are meant to provide external access to applications you don\u2019t want to open up to the world. Good advice regarding peering the networks. VPN Gateways also support P2S connections, so perhaps your users could connect directly to the Azure VNet and access the system that way. 1 level 2 nickbrown1968 Op \u00b7 1 yr. ago Thanks for the response. To be clear the \"internal\" application is hosted in Azure (on a single server), but wasn't written with the intention of being publicly accessible. Trying to answer my own question, I looked at what they had in common: Both can make web apps publicly accessible Both terminate and proxy the connection I then looked at their differences: AG\n[3]: URL: https://rfwireless-world.com/terminology/application-gateway-vs-circuit-level-gateway.html --- Title: Difference btw Application Gateway and Circuit level Gateway --- Body: Difference btw Application Gateway and Circuit level Gateway Home of RF and Wireless Vendors and Resources Application Gateway Vs Circuit level Gateway | Difference between Application Gateway and Circuit level Gateway This page compares Application Gateway Vs Circuit level Gateway and mentions difference between Application Gateway and Circuit level Gateway with packet filters. Application Gateway \u2022 Host which is running proxy service is known as Application Gateway. This is needed as packet filtering routers do not allow TELNET and FTP connections. Both packet filtering routers and application gateway are used together to provide high levele of security as well as flexibility. \u2022 A user which needs to connect with in-bound site need to first connect with application gateway and later to destination host. \u2022 There are many benefits of using application gateway such as information hiding, robust authentication & logging, cost effectiveness and less complex filtering rules etc. \u2022 The disadvantages of application gateway is TELNET connectivity requires two steps to connect either inbound or outbound. Moreover here user need to connect with firewall rather than connecting with host directly. \u2022 Examples: TELNET, FTP, E-mail Circuit level Gateway \u2022 It relays TCP connections . \u2022 No processing or filtering of protocol is done by circuit level gateway. \u2022 Example#1: NNTP server and NNTP client, here both connects with the firewall and later they can communicate directly bypassing the firewall. This means firewall simply passes bytes between the end systems. \u2022 Example#2: Once the connection is established using application gateway, firewall simply passes bytes between the hosts. This is another example of circuit level gateway. Following table mentions difference between Application Gateway, Circuit Level Gateway and Packet filters. Packet filters Application Gateway Circuit level Gateway Simple and least secure Most secure approach More secure than packet filter but not as secure as application gateway. Many routers provide this functionality Unique program for each application Relay TCP connections Passes or rejects packets based on rules good for authentication and logging Permission granted by port address Hard to manage Not always transparent to users No application level checking Easy to make mistakes Used for email, FTP, TELNET, WWW Can understand what is carried in the packet.

Azure CDN vs Azure Front Door versus Azure Application Gateway (WAF) vs Azure Traffic Manager TL;DR If you do not want to go through the entire post, here is a brief summary of the different options ; My gut feeling tells me this will already help out like a lot! Web Application Firewall (WAF) : Azure Front Door vs Azure Application Gateway Both Azure Front Door and Azure Application Gatewa y state that they can be configured to act as a Web Application Firewall. They key difference here is that the Azure Application Gateway can do a \u201cdetection only\u201d-mode and that it supports CRS 2.2.9, 3.0, and 3.1. This means that there are out-of-the-box rules that provide a baseline security against most of the top-10 vulnerabilities that Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) identifies. With Azure Front Door, you need to configure the rules yourself to your liking. In terms of networking, there also is a very important difference between both. An Azure Application Gateway can be deployed (injected) in(to) an Azure VNET (Virtual Network). By doing so, the traffic between this gateway and your internal backend will flow through a private network. With Azure Front Door, your backend is always based on a public endpoint. Though you can harden / lock down the connectivity between Azure Front Door and your application by restricting the ingress of the traffic. Geographic Redundancy : Azure Front Door vs Azure Traffic Manager If you want to publish your webapp across regions, then you can leverage Azure Front Door or Azure Traffic Manager to do so. The most important thing to know is that Azure Traffic Manager is DNS based and serves as a redirection mechanism. Azure Front Door will serve as an entrypoint (think reverse proxy). So when using Traffic Manager, you will typically look\n[5]: URL: https://peerspot.com/products/comparisons/cloudflare-web-application-firewall_vs_microsoft-azure-application-gateway --- Title: Cloudflare Web Application Firewall vs Microsoft Azure ... --- Body: Cloudflare Web Application Firewall vs Microsoft Azure Application Gateway Comparison 2022 | PeerSpot Home Cloudflare Web Application Firewall vs. Microsoft Azure Application Gateway Cloudflare Web Application Firewall vs Microsoft Azure Application Gateway comparison Top Review Pros & Cons Pricing Popular Questions Comparisons Cloudflare Web Application Firewall vs. Microsoft Azure Application Gateway report Cloudflare Web Application Firewall Read 3 Cloudflare Web Application Firewall reviews. 2,219 views|1,727 comparisons Microsoft Azure Application Gateway Read 12 Microsoft Azure Application Gateway reviews. 25,481 views|22,836 comparisons Featured Review Anonymous User Principal Architect at a mining and metals company Researched Microsoft Azure Application Gateway but chose Cloudflare Web Application Firewall: A SaaS solution that is API configurable and a convenient part of a suite but needs updating of core rules Sukun Jain Senior Software Engineer at Varian Medical Systems, Inc.

Listing the available webjobs (4 of them) takes minutes. Stopping a webjob results many times in a time-out. Publishing a webjob from VS2015 takes about 10 min. Also publishing our WebApp takes 10-12 min. Loading the process explorer in KUDO, takes minutes as well. Does these management tools run on our WebApp instance? Meaning if our WebApp is busy the Portal is slow as well? I thought the Portal runs on its own instance. I already tried stopping all webjobs and even the WebApp, but Azure Portal stays slow.

All applications assigned to an App Service plan share the resources defined by it allowing you to save cost when hosting multiple apps. Kudu is the engine behind git deployments in Azure App Service. It can also run outside of Azure. Which App Service Plan are you using? On which region have you deployed your services/Apps?

Here are some advice to troubleshoot this scenario. First of all, we want to ensure the update statistics with fullscan is done anyway and the query plan used in on-premise and Azure SQL are the same. If we are dealing with different query plan, then we are not comparing apple to apple. Use the select wait_type, * from sys.dm_exec_requests to double check what resource the query is waiting for when the query is running. If the slow performance is caused by network latency, you should be able to see the query is suspended on ASYNC_NETWORK_IO. To confirm it is stuck in waiting for network resource, you will need to run this dmv continuously. Ensure your DTU is not max out. You can run Select * FROM sys.dm_db_resource_stats or check your portal. Use BCP to test if it is pure network issue or some other application issue. You can find bcp example below. Change the packet size in bcp if possible to see if you can benefit from it. In bcp, it is parameter -a. In above example, I used packet size 32768. Check if it is possible to send concurrent requests in the same time to increase the throughput. Test and try to move to different data center if possible. Test and try to move the application server to azure if possible. Bcp example: Sample syntax is: bcp \"select top 10000000 * from dbo.[tablename]\" queryout C:\\BCP\\test.bcp -d dbname -U username@ servername -n -S tcp:dwsql01eastus2.database.windows.net -P password -a 32768 -o D:\\BCP\\Output.log I have seen that bcp shows fast performance but not the application. Later we are able to find that the slow transfer rate is due to application made many unnecessary connections to the database. Hope it helps.

Delays can happen for multiple reasons, such as request throttling or the way your application is designed. This article explains the different root causes for this problem. Request rate too large Request throttling is the most common reason for slow requests. Azure Cosmos DB throttles requests if they exceed the allocated request units for the database or container. The SDK has built-in logic to retry these requests. The request rate too large troubleshooting article explains how to check if the requests are being throttled. The article also discusses how to scale your account to avoid these problems in the future. Application design When you design your application, follow the .NET SDK best practices for the best performance. If your application doesn't follow the SDK best practices, you might get slow or failed requests. Consider the following when developing your application: The application should be in the same region as your Azure Cosmos DB account. The SDK has several caches that have to be initialized, which might slow down the first few requests. The connectivity mode should be direct and TCP. Avoid high CPU. Make sure to look at the maximum CPU and not the average, which is the default for most logging systems. Anything above roughly 40 percent can increase the latency. Metadata operations If you need to verify that a database or container exists, don't do so by calling Create...IfNotExistsAsync or Read...Async before doing an item operation. The validation should only be done on application startup when it's necessary, if you expect them to be deleted. These metadata operations generate extra latency, have no service-level agreement (SLA), and have their own separate limitations. They don't scale like data operations. Slow requests on bulk mode Bulk mode is a throughput optimized mode meant for high data volume operations, not a latency optimized mode; it's meant to saturate the available throughput.

You can use this information to identify problems that may be occurring or to identify improvements to the application that would most impact users. This tutorial takes you through the process of analyzing the performance of both the server components of your application and the perspective of the client. You learn how to: Identify the performance of server-side operations Analyze server operations to determine the root cause of slow performance Identify slowest client-side operations Analyze details of page views using query language Prerequisites To complete this tutorial: Install Visual Studio 2019 with the following workloads: ASP.NET and web development Azure development Deploy a .NET application to Azure and enable the Application Insights SDK. Enable the Application Insights profiler for your application. Log in to Azure Log in to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com. Identify slow server operations Application Insights collects performance details for the different operations in your application. By identifying those operations with the longest duration, you can diagnose potential problems or best target your ongoing development to improve the overall performance of the application. Select Application Insights and then select your subscription. To open the Performance panel either select Performance under the Investigate menu or click the Server Response Time graph. The Performance panel shows the count and average duration of each operation for the application. You can use this information to identify those operations that most impact users. In this example, the GET Customers/Details and GET Home/Index are likely candidates to investigate because of their relatively high duration and number of calls. Other operations may have a higher duration but were rarely called, so the effect of their improvement would be minimal. The graph currently shows the average duration of the selected operations over time. You can switch to the 95th percentile to find the performance issues. Add the operations that you're interested in by pinning them to the graph. This shows that there are some peaks worth investigating.

However, when I split my VMs (no excuses, I need to have the design like this), on an hybrid cenario with my back-end on-prem and my front-end on Azure, the connectivity is ultra-slow (with VPN, using RRAS). RAW transfer data it's quite good (>50 MB\\s), however, when I do some request's on my back-end, an query estimated to have 30 seconds of duration can easily take more than 2(!!!) minutes.When traffic is sent from my datacenter, I monitored, and the performance is very good. Then traffics is sent from Azure, the results are really bad. Any suggestion?

Noting the fact that raw data transfer speeds are good over the VPN (from on-prem to MS Azure). When you say Raw data transfer, I assume you've tested some random file copying. Having said that, I suspect if the VPN has any speed issues. In order to test your application, you may setup your front and back ends on two different machines On-Prem and/or on MS Azure (within a vNet) and check the latency on querying. Once the results are good, you may troubleshoot the delay in a Hybrid environment by retrieving TCP route traces. You may also consider using a Windows VM for testing purposes. Lastly, ExpressRoute (even though it's an expensive solution) will give your dedicated bandwidth of which you can be sure of the time taken for a query, which might be significantly faster than the existing speeds. Note: We recommend that you use the gallery image (from Management Portal) of Linux OS on the VMs you create on MS Azure.

The Transit Gateway allows you to connect multiple VPCs together as well as VPN tunnels to on-premises networks through a single gateway device. As a consultant, I talk with customers often, about how they will plan to connect their data center with the AWS cloud, and how to interconnect all of those VPCs. In the past a solution like Aviatrix or a Cisco CSR transit gateway was used which leveraged some EC2 instances that lived within a VPC. You\u2019d then connect spoke VPCs together via the use of VPN tunnels. With this new solution, there is a native service from AWS that allows you to do this without the need for VPN tunnels between spoke VPCs and you can use the AWS CLI/CloudFormation or console to deploy everything you need. This post takes you through an example of the setup of the AWS Transit Gateway in my own lab environment. Architecture Before we talk about the setup steps, lets take a look at what we\u2019ll be building. The diagram below shows the overall configuration. At the bottom of the diagram we have my on-premises home lab which will be inter-connected to the AWS cloud through a VPN connection terminating a on the Transit Gateway. The Transit Gateway will live within Account 1 and will need to be attached not only to a VPN tunnel, but also to a VPC within the same account and another VPC in a second (spoke) account. The rest of the setup depends on route tables to ensure that EC2 instances will direct traffic destined between VPCs or Data Centers through this transit gateway service. Setup Transit Gateway Between AWS VPC First, lets take a look at setting up the Transit Gateway so that machines in different VPCs can communicate with each other through it. To begin, login to the AWS console under the account you want your Transit Gateway to be owned, and look for the Transit Gateways menu under the VPCs window. Click the \u201cCreate Transit Gateway\u201d button. Go through the create transit gateway wizard and fill in the information. Enter a name and description so that its easily identifiable.

Technical Question I've got two vnets that I peered, WVD and East. East has a virtual network gateway peered to it, from which we can RDP to Azure VMs and connect to other resources from our company network and VPN. I created test VMs connected to the WVD vnet, which uses the 10.100.0.0/16 IP range, but RDP attempts fail. I've added an NSG rule to allow TCP 3389 from my home IP, as well as the IP range given to machines VPNed in. Still no RDPs - it just never connects. Pinging times out, tracert goes as far as our VPN uplink IP. I created a peering. All traffic is allowed. The local vnet is set to use the remote vnet gateway, but Gateway Transit is set to Disabled. The remote vnet has traffic allowed, and it's set to use its own vnet gateway. How do I go about getting the vnets peered so I can RDP to these VMs? I can't seem to find a way to just flip Disabled to Enabled. I deleted and re-created the peering and the same situation persisted. Our network admin added the range to all routes and firewall tables to allow traffic in and out, so as far as I know there's no networking issues on our side. Edit: the Disabled status is as expected, since it's shown on the WVD vnet, it's indicating that the gateway is on the remote vnet side and in use. The RDP issue ended up resolving itself, not sure how - other VMs in the WVD vnet that I spun up are working as well. Weird one. 2 comments 81% Upvoted Log in or sign up to leave a comment Log In Sign Up Sort by: best level 1 \u00b7 8 mo. ago Why so you have a VPN Gateway? 1 level 1 \u00b7 8 mo. ago Use bastion for RDP.

Delivery AWS Transit Gateway AWS Transit Gateway pricing In AWS Transit Gateway you are charged for the number of connections that you make to the Transit Gateway per hour and the amount of traffic that flows through AWS Transit Gateway. You can create a Transit Gateway to connect to multiple Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (Amazon VPCs), Direct Connect, VPNs and Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) appliances, and that Transit Gateway can work across accounts. The VPC account owner is billed hourly for each hour that their Amazon VPCs are attached to an AWS Transit Gateway. For AWS VPN attachments, the Transit Gateway owner is billed hourly. For AWS Direct Connect attachments, the Direct Connect Gateway owner is billed hourly. For Transit Gateway Connect attachments (SD-WAN appliances), the Transit Gateway owner is billed hourly. For peering attachments, each Transit Gateway owner is billed hourly for the peering attachment with the other Transit Gateway. Hourly billing will also start when the Transit Gateway owner accepts your VPC and it stops when the attachment is deleted. Each partial VPC Transit Gateway hour consumed is billed as a full hour. Similarly, a VPN attachment will be charged hourly. AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection pricing still applies in addition to AWS Transit Gateway VPN attachment pricing. Please see the product page for AWS Site-to-Site VPN pricing. Data processing charges apply for each gigabyte sent from a VPC, Direct Connect or VPN to the AWS Transit Gateway. There are no additional data processing charges for Transit Gateway Connect other than those applied to the underlying VPC or Direct Connect attachment. Data processing charges also apply to each gigabyte received by each multicast receiver instance. Data processing charges do not apply for data sent from a peering attachment to a Transit Gateway. Data transferred over a peering attachment incurs the standard inter-Region data transfer charges as explained in the EC2 on-demand pricing page. Sorry, an error was encountered while retrieving pricing data. (Try Again) Pricing example You created an AWS Transit Gateway in US East (Ohio) and attached an Amazon VPC to it. You created a route to send traffic to another VPC via the Transit Gateway. 1 GB of data was sent from an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance in that VPC to another VPC.

Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals Certification \u2013 Is It Worth It? By A.P. Samuel | Jan 15, 2021 What is Microsoft Azure Fundamentals Certification? Microsoft Azure Fundamentals is a foundation-level Cloud certification that develops your skills and validates expertise in basic Cloud computing concepts. It is based on Azure, which is the Cloud service offered by Microsoft. The certification is primarily designed for individuals with non-technical backgrounds who want to start a career in Cloud computing. The Microsoft Azure Cloud platform has an over 18% share of the nearly $100 billion Cloud market, as of the fourth quarter of 2019. Azure is used by thousands of small, medium, and large companies worldwide, including Starbucks, Pixar, Apple iCloud, Easy Jet, Samsung, eBay, and Boeing. Due to Azure\u2019s significant share of the Cloud services market, getting the Azure Fundamentals certification would provide you with a strong jumpstart if you want to launch a career in the Cloud industry. Microsoft offers three types of certifications: Fundamental Certifications: These certifications teach and validate foundation technological concepts. Role-Based Certifications: These certifications teach and validate more complex technological concepts and prepare you for specific job roles. Expert Certifications: These certifications teach and validate in-depth technical skills for managing and integrating Microsoft platforms in the Cloud. Azure Fundamentals belongs to the first category, as it teaches and validates core concepts and skills related to the Azure Cloud platform and overall Cloud industry. According to Robert Half\u2019s 2020 IT salary report, Cloud Architect and Cloud Administrator are two of the top 10 highly paid and in-demand jobs of 2020. According to Global Knowledge\u2019s Top-Paying IT Certifications 2020 report, Azure Fundamentals is the 11 th most lucrative IT certification for 2020, with an average salary of over $126,000 US dollars. The Microsoft Azure Fundamentals exam tests your understanding of four main areas: Understanding of Cloud Concepts Understanding of Core Azure Services Understanding of Security, Privacy, Compliance, and Trust, and Understanding of Azure Pricing and Support To pass the test, you must get a score of at least 700. According to the latest exam guidelines, the Azure Fundamentals certification exam has 40-60 questions. The certification exam costs $99. Most of the questions in the Azure Fundamentals certification exam\n[2]: URL: https://c-sharpcorner.com/article/how-to-easily-az-900-microsoft-azure-fundamentals-certification-exam --- Title: How To Pass AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals ... --- Body: How To Pass AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals Certification Exam \u2601\ud83c\udf93 How To Pass AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals Certification Exam \u2601\ud83c\udf93 Kasam Shaikh Updated date Sep 07, 2019 83.3k 0 17 facebook twitter linkedIn Reddit Expand Introduction After a long process of self-motivating, I finally appeared for AZ-900 \u2013 Azure Fundamentals certification exam, and guess what, I cleared the exam in the first take \ud83d\ude0a.

To learn more about capacity reservations, see the overview article. Because both the VM and the underlying Capacity Reservation logically occupy capacity, Azure imposes some constraints on this process to avoid ambiguous allocation states and unexpected errors. There are two ways to change an association: Option 1: Deallocate the virtual machine, change the Capacity Reservation group property, and optionally restart the virtual machine Option 2: Update the reserved quantity to zero and then change the Capacity Reservation group property Deallocate the VM The first option is to deallocate the VM, change the Capacity Reservation group property, and optionally restart the VM.

This option works well when the virtual machine can\u2019t be deallocated and when a reservation is no longer needed. For example, you may create a Capacity Reservation to temporarily assure capacity during a large-scale deployment. Once completed, the reservation is no longer needed.

Does it need any other azure service or can be it achieved with existing services/configuration. azure-webapps-content-deployment azure-traffic-manager Save 2 Answers Created Oldest Votes 1 SnehaAgrawal-MSFT answered Feb 17 2020 at 10:37 PM AkashSamal-8200 ACCEPTED ANSWER Danejahtt-0724 \u2022 Jul 19 2020 at 1:15 AM|SnehaAgrawal-MSFT \u2022 Jul 20 2020 at 7:05 AM Jul 20 2020 at 7:05 AM\n[3]: URL: https://reddit.com/r/azure/comments/djq5os/block_all_traffic_by_country --- Title: Block all traffic by country : AZURE --- Body: Block all traffic by country : AZURE 3 Posted by u/ExR90 3 years ago Block all traffic by country I want to block all inbound traffic from most countries. I realize that isn't foolproof and can easily be bypassed using VPN or proxy, but it will help. I know you can block vnet access by IP, but the list of subnets would be staggeringly large, and still too large if I do it in reverse and block all except native country. In most firewalls there is a simple \"block X countries\" function. I see no such function within Azure for standard traffic to VNET's (though I do see one for web apps). My thought would be to spin up an instance of pFsense or another firewall, and configure my vnet to use it for in/out and do the blocking there. Just wanting to see if anyone has a better idea before I do so. 9 comments 72% Upvoted Log in or sign up to leave a comment Log In Sign Up Sort by: best level 1 OutsideTech \u00b7 3 yr. ago It depends on the traffic that will be filtered, if it's only http/https then as you mentioned it can be done with Web Application Firewall/Front Door. If the need is to filter non-http/https traffic then Azure Firewall (not WAF) cannot currently do it, FAQ. Azure Firewall is also quite expensive. NVA, for Network Virtual Appliance, is the Azure term. pfSense is an option, many other vendors have pre-built instances or you can build your own. 4 level 2 ExR90 Op \u00b7 3 yr. ago Thanks. Sounds like I'm on the right track. 1 level 1 hagge \u00b7 3 yr. ago You need something more than a Network Security Group so some type of Network Appliance makes sense.

Contact support Outbound email messages that are sent directly to external domains (such as outlook.com and gmail.com) from a virtual machine (VM) are made available only to certain subscription types in Microsoft Azure. Important For all examples below, the process applies only to Virtual Machines & VM Scale Sets resources (Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines & Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets ). Sending email on Port 25 is unsupported from all Azure Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) resources, including Azure App Service and Azure Functions. Recommended method of sending email We recommend you use authenticated SMTP relay services to send email from Azure VMs or from Azure App Service. (These relay services typically connect through TCP port 587, but they support other ports.) These services are used to maintain IP and domain reputation to minimize the possibility that external domains reject your messages or put them to the SPAM folder. SendGrid is one such SMTP relay service, but there are others. You might also have an authenticated SMTP relay service on your on-premises servers. Using these email delivery services isn't restricted in Azure, regardless of the subscription type. Enterprise Agreement For VMs that are deployed in standard Enterprise Agreement subscriptions, the outbound SMTP connections on TCP port 25 will not be blocked. However, there is no guarantee that external domains will accept the incoming emails from the VMs. If your emails are rejected or filtered by the external domains, you should contact the email service providers of the external domains to resolve the problems. These problems are not covered by Azure support. For Enterprise Dev/Test subscriptions, port 25 is blocked by default. It is possible to have this block removed. To request to have the block removed, go to the Cannot send email (SMTP-Port 25) section of the Diagnose and Solve blade in the Azure Virtual Network resource in the Azure portal and run the diagnostic. This will exempt the qualified enterprise dev/test subscriptions automatically. After the subscription is exempted from this block and the VMs are stopped and restarted, all VMs in that subscription are exempted going forward. The exemption applies only to the subscription requested and only to VM traffic that is\n[5]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/web-application-firewall/ag/geomatch-custom-rules --- Title: Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) Geomatch custom rules ... --- Body: Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) Geomatch custom rules | Microsoft Docs Azure Networking Web Application Firewall Geomatch custom rules Article 07/30/2021 2 minutes to read 3 contributors In this article Country/Region codes Next steps Custom rules allow you to create tailored rules to suit the exact needs of your applications and security policies. Now, you can restrict access to your web applications by country/region. As with all custom rules, this logic can be compounded with other rules to suit the needs of your application. To create a geo-filtering custom rule in the Azure portal, simply select Geo location as the Match Type, and then select the country/region or countries/regions you want to allow/block from your application. When creating geomatch rules with Azure PowerShell or Azure Resource Manager, use the match variable RemoteAddr and the operator Geomatch. For more information, see how to create custom rules in PowerShell and more custom rule examples. Country/Region codes If you are using the Geomatch operator, the selectors can be any of the following two-digit country/region codes.

(preview) overview | Microsoft Docs Azure Functions Start/Stop VMs v2 (preview) overview Article 11/12/2021 5 minutes to read 4 contributors In this article Overview New releases Supported scoping options Prerequisites Next steps The Start/Stop VMs v2 (preview) feature starts or stops Azure virtual machines (VMs) across multiple subscriptions. It starts or stops Azure VMs on user-defined schedules, provides insights through Azure Application Insights, and send optional notifications by using action groups. The feature can manage both Azure Resource Manager VMs and classic VMs for most scenarios. This new version of Start/Stop VMs v2 (preview) provides a decentralized low-cost automation option for customers who want to optimize their VM costs. It offers all of the same functionality as the original version available with Azure Automation, but it is designed to take advantage of newer technology in Azure. Overview Start/Stop VMs v2 (preview) is redesigned and it doesn't depend on Azure Automation or Azure Monitor Logs, as required by the previous version. This version relies on Azure Functions to handle the VM start and stop execution. A managed identity is created in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for this Azure Functions application and allows Start/Stop VMs v2 (preview) to easily access other Azure AD-protected resources, such as the logic apps and Azure VMs. For more about managed identities in Azure AD, see Managed identities for Azure resources. An HTTP trigger endpoint function is created to support the schedule and sequence scenarios included with the feature, as shown in the following table. Name Trigger Description Scheduled HTTP This function is for both scheduled and sequenced scenario (differentiated by the payload schema). It is the entry point function called from the Logic App and takes the payload to process the VM start or stop operation. AutoStop HTTP This function supports the AutoStop scenario, which is the entry point function that is called from Logic App. AutoStopVM HTTP This function is triggered automatically by the VM alert when the alert condition is true. VirtualMachineRequestOrchestrator Queue This function gets the payload information from the Scheduled function and orchestrates the VM start and stop requests. VirtualMachineRequestExecutor Queue This function performs the actual start and stop operation on the VM. CreateAutoStopAlertExecutor Queue This function gets the payload information from the AutoStop function to create the alert on the VM. HeartBeatAvailabilityTest Timer This function monitors the availability of the primary HTTP functions.

The error can occur when you deploy resources with an Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template) or Bicep file. Symptom During a deployment, you might receive a RequestDisallowedByPolicy error that prevents you from creating a resource. Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, and the Azure portal's activity log show similar information about the error. The key elements are the error code, policy assignment, and policy definition. Output Copy \"statusMessage\": \"{\"error\":{\"code\":\"RequestDisallowedByPolicy\", \"target\":\"examplenic1207\", \"message\":\"Resource `examplenic1207` was disallowed by policy. Policy identifiers: \"policyAssignment\":{\"name\":\"Network interfaces should not have public IPs\", \"id\":\"/subscriptions/{guid}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/1111aa2222bb3333cc4444dd\"} \"policyDefinition\":{\"name\":\"Network interfaces should not have public IPs\", \"id\":\"/subscriptions/{guid}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/83a86a26-fd1f-447c-b59d-e51f44264114\"} The name of a policyAssignment or policyDefinition is the last segment of the id string. The {guid} placeholder represents an Azure subscription ID. Cause In this example, the error occurred when an administrator attempted to create a network interface with a public IP address. A policy assignment enables enforcement of a built-in policy definition that prevents public IPs on network interfaces. You can use the name of a policy assignment or policy definition to get more details about a policy that caused the error. The example commands use placeholders for input. For example, replace <policy definition name> including the angle brackets, with the definition name from your error message. Azure CLI PowerShell To get more information about a policy definition, use az policy definition show. Azure CLI Copy defname= <policy definition name>az policy definition show --name $defname To get more information about a policy assignment, use az policy assignment show. Azure CLI Copy rg= <resource group name>assignmentname= <policy assignment name>az policy assignment show --name $assignmentname --resource-group $rg Solution For security or compliance, your subscription administrators might assign policies that limit how resources are deployed. For example, policies that prevent creating public IP addresses, network security groups, user-defined routes, or route tables. To resolve RequestDisallowedByPolicy errors, review the resource policies and determine how to deploy resources that comply with those policies.

Security: Policies may be in place to prevent the creation of resources that could pose security risks or vulnerabilities. For example, a policy might disallow the creation of resources with open public endpoints or weak access controls.\n\n2. Compliance: Policies can enforce compliance with industry, regulatory, or organizational requirements. This could include restrictions on data handling, encryption, or access controls.\n\n3. Cost Management: Policies may aim to control costs by preventing the creation of certain resource types or configurations that could result in excessive spending.\n\n4. Governance: Policies can be used to enforce organizational standards, naming conventions, or resource tagging requirements to ensure consistent management and visibility of resources.\n\nBy disallowing requests that violate these policies, organizations can maintain a secure and compliant Azure environment.

Let me share the small fix here as this is nowhere documented in the Microsoft internal and external or any blog. Issue: We were getting the following popup which opening any application from RDWeb page. Your computer can\u2019t connect to the remote computer because authentication to the firewall failed due to missing firewall credentials. To resolve the issue, go to the firewall website that your network administrator recommends, and then try the connection again, or contact your network administrator for assistance. Resolution: I got the same popup in IE but I added RDWeb URL in the trusted sites and it went away. For non-IE browsers from the internet, we were getting this error which means my non-Microsoft OS users can\u2019t use RDWeb. We opened a Microsoft case to fix this but Microsoft was clueless and reviewed multiple logs, involved WAP team, and other escalation teams. At the same time, Microsoft referred me to the TechNet link. https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn765486.aspx After reviewing the link, I figured out that I had run the following command Set-RDSessionCollectionConfiguration -CollectionName \u201cMyAppCollection\u201d -CustomRdpProperty \u201cpre-authentication server address:s :ht tps://rdg.contoso. com\u2019nrequire pre-authentication:i:1\u2033` But I should have run this command.

The official doc has been published to Microsoft Azure docs. AZ support for App Service Environments (ASEs) is also available, see Availability Zone support for App Service Environments. Additionally, AZ support for the Azure Functions Premium plan is now available, see Azure Functions support for availability zone redundancy. Availability Zone Overview An Availability Zone is a high-availability offering that protects your applications and data from datacenter failures. Availability Zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region. Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. To ensure resiliency, there\u2019s a minimum of three separate zones in all enabled regions. Build high-availability into your application architecture by co-locating your compute, storage, networking, and data resources within a zone and replicating in other zones. To learn more about Availability Zones, continue reading here. Requirements AZ support, otherwise known as zone redundancy, is a property of the App Service Plan (ASP). The following are the current requirements/limitations for enabling zone redundancy: Both Windows and Linux are supported Requires either Premium v2 or Premium v3 App Service Plans Minimum instance count of 3 The platform will enforce this minimum count behind the scenes if you specify an instance count fewer than 3. This is due to the platform automatically spreading these VMs across 3 zones when zone redundancy is enabled.

This architecture is also known as zone redundancy. When you configure to be zone redundant, the platform automatically spreads the instances of the Azure App Service plan across all three zones in the selected region. If you specify a capacity larger than three, and the number of instances is divisible by three, the instances are spread evenly. Otherwise, instance counts beyond 3*N are spread across the remaining one or two zones. Note This article is about App Service Environment v3, which is used with isolated v2 App Service plans. You configure zone redundancy when you create your App Service Environment, and all App Service plans created in that App Service Environment will be zone redundant. You can only specify zone redundancy when you're creating a new App Service Environment. Zone redundancy is only supported in a subset of regions. When a zone goes down, the App Service platform detects lost instances and automatically attempts to find new, replacement instances. If you also have auto-scale configured, and if it determines that more instances are needed, auto-scale also issues a request to App Service to add more instances. Auto-scale behavior is independent of App Service platform behavior. There's no guarantee that requests for instances in a zone-down scenario will succeed, because back-filling lost instances occurs on a best effort basis. It's a good idea to scale your App Service plans to account for losing a zone. Applications deployed in a zone redundant App Service Environment continue to run and serve traffic, even if other zones in the same region suffer an outage. It's possible, however, that non-runtime behaviors might still be affected by an outage in other availability zones. These behaviors might include App Service plan scaling, application creation, application configuration, and application publishing. Zone redundancy for App Service Environment only ensures continued uptime for deployed applications. When the App Service platform allocates instances to a zone redundant App Service plan, it uses best effort zone balancing offered by the underlying Azure virtual machine scale sets. An App Service plan is considered balanced if each zone has either the same\n[3]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/environment/zone-redundancy --- Title: Availability Zone support for App Service Environments ... --- Body: Availability Zone support for App Service Environment v2 - Azure App Service Environment | Microsoft Docs Azure App Service Web Apps Availability Zone support for App Service Environment v2 Article 03/29/2022 4 minutes to read 7 contributors In this article How to Deploy an App Service Environment in an Availability Zone In-region data residency Important This article is about App Service Environment v2 which is used with Isolated App Service plans. App Service Environment v2 will be retired on 31 August 2024. There's a new version of App Service Environment that is easier to use and runs on more powerful infrastructure. To learn more about the new version, start with the Introduction to the App Service Environment. If you're currently using App Service Environment v2, please follow the steps in this article to migrate to the new version. App Service Environment v2 (ASE) can be deployed into Availability Zones (AZ). Customers can deploy an internal load balancer (ILB) ASEs into a specific AZ within an Azure region. If you pin your ILB ASE to a specific AZ, the resources used by a ILB ASE will either be pinned to the specified AZ, or deployed in a zone redundant manner. An ILB ASE that is explicitly deployed into an AZ is considered a zonal resource because the ILB ASE is pinned to a specific zone. The following ILB ASE dependencies will be pinned to the specified zone: the internal load balancer IP address of the ASE the compute resources used by the ASE to manage and run web applications The remote file storage for web applications deployed on a zonal ILB ASE uses Zone Redundant Storage (ZRS). Unless the steps described in this article are followed, ILB ASEs are not automatically deployed in a zonal manner. You cannot pin an External ASE with a public IP address to a specific availability zone.

This architecture is also known as zone redundancy. An app lives in an App Service plan (ASP), and the App Service plan exists in a single scale unit. When an App Service is configured to be zone redundant, the platform automatically spreads the VM instances in the App Service plan across all three zones in the selected region. If a capacity larger than three is specified and the number of instances is divisible by three, the instances will be spread evenly. Otherwise, instance counts beyond 3*N will get spread across the remaining one or two zones.

Replicating your deployments across multiple zones, ensures that local outages limited to a zone do not negatively impact the availability of your application. This architecture shows how you can improve the resiliency of an ASE deployment by deploying in multiple availability zones. These zones are not related to proximity. They can map to different physical locations for different subscriptions. This architecture assumes a single subscription deployment. A reference implementation for this architecture is available on GitHub. Architecture The contents of the ASE subnets used in this reference implementation are the same as the ones in the standard ASE deployment architecture described here. This reference implementation replicates the deployment in two ASE subnets. Each subnet has its own web app, API, and function instances running in their individual App Service plans. The Redis cache required by the applications are also replicated for better performance. Note that the scope of this reference architecture is limited to a single region. The following section shows the nature of availability for services used in this architecture: App Services Environments can be deployed to multiple availability zones, only in internal or ILB mode. This reference implementation deploys two ASE subnets, each one in a different availability zone. At the minimum, two availability zones are recommended for end-to-end resiliency of your application. All of the runtime ILB ASE resources will be located in the specified zone: the internal load balancer IP address of the ASE, the compute resources as well as the underlying file storage required by the ASE to run all the apps deployed on that ASE. For detailed guidance and recommendations, read App Service Environment Support for Availability Zones. Azure Virtual Network or Vnet spans all availability zones limited to a single region. The subnets within the VNet also span across availability zones. This reference architecture creates a subnet for each ASE deployment created for an availability zone. For more information, read the network requirements for App Service Environments. Application Gateway v2 is zone-redundant. Like the virtual network, it spans multiple availability zones per region. This in turn means, a single application gateway is sufficient for a highly available system,\n", "messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!

These changes take effect on June 2. 2021. New capacity reservation naming Capacity reservations are now called commitment tiers. New, higher commitment tiers We are introducing new commitment tiers for both Azure Sentinel and Azure Monitor Log Analytics for higher data ingestion: 1 TB/Day, 2 TB/Day, and 5 TB/Day. Changes to how we bill for data ingestion over your commitment tiers Data ingested beyond your selected commitment tier will now be billed using the effective commitment tier rate, instead of the pay-as-you-go rate, resulting in a lower bill. For example, for Azure Sentinel in the East US region, if you are on a 500 GB/day commitment tier, you will now be billed for overage at $0.80/GB (i.e. the effective rate for that tier) instead of the $2/GB pay-as-you-go rate. Simplification of commitment tiers You can now select from eight distinct commitment tiers and no longer need to manage tiers due to minor changes in data ingestion. As part of this change, any workspaces with commitment tiers greater than 500 GB/day will be reset to the lowest available commitment tier \u2013 500 GB/day, 1 TB/day, 2 TB/day, or 5 TB/day.

We have seen Azure Sentinel and the promise of cloud-native SIEM result in cost savings, both direct and indirect, for many of our customers. The 2020 commissioned Forrester Consulting Total Economic Impact\u2122 of Microsoft Azure Sentinel study, for example, found that Azure Sentinel delivered a 48% reduction in costs compared to legacy SIEMs, saving on expenses like licensing, storage, and infrastructure costs. Today, we are pleased to announce changes to the pricing of Azure Sentinel and Azure Monitor Log Analytics that will offer you additional cost savings. These changes take effect on June 2. The changes include: New capacity reservation naming Capacity reservations are now called commitment tiers. You will see this change reflected in your user interface, in documentation, as well as on Azure Sentinel and Azure Monitor pricing pages and in the pricing calculator. New, higher commitment tiers We are introducing new commitment tiers for both Azure Sentinel and Azure Monitor Log Analytics for higher data ingestion: 1 TB/Day, 2 TB/Day, and 5 TB/Day. Changes to how we bill for data ingestion over your commitment tiers We are also changing the way we bill for overage. Data ingested beyond your selected commitment tier will now be billed using the effective commitment tier rate, instead of the Pay-as-you-go rate, resulting in a lower bill. For example, for Azure Sentinel in the East US region, if you are on a 500 GB/day commitment tier, you will now be billed for overage at $0.80/GB (i.e. the effective rate for that tier) instead of the $2/GB pay-as-you-go rate. Simplification of commitment tiers We are simplifying commitment tiers to make them easier to manage. You can now select from eight distinct commitment tiers, per your needs, and no longer need to manage tiers due to minor changes in data ingestion patterns. As part of this change, any workspaces with commitment tiers greater than 500 GB/day will be reset to the lowest available commitment tier \u2013 500 GB/day, 1 TB/day, 2 TB/day, or 5 TB/day.

According to the pricing site the price is calculated per GB per month. But when I configure the retention period I have days as steps, so I can configure less than a month. So, I'm curious whether I have to pay 1 month for every started month, or the price is devided by the days in the month. So +15 days (above the free days) is calculated as +1 month or it is calculated as +1/2 months (15 days)? The pricing calculator actually accepts decimals in the months field, but I'm not sure whether this is just a coding issue or you actually pay per day.

You can upgrade your requested commitment at any time. However, the minimum commitment period before you can opt out or reduce your capacity reservation is 31 days. Adding more capacity to your commitment tier \u2013 You can upgrade your requested commitment at any time. Your new commitment tier will be effective at the start of the next UTC day. Reducing your selected commitment tier \u2013 You can reduce your commitment tier or opt out entirely from the commitment tier model after the first 31 days.

Still, many IT pros rely on Azure Sentinel from Microsoft \u2013 especially when they already use Microsoft\u2019s proven suite of software for other applications. Many organizations want to ensure their important data is together in one place, stored securely in Microsoft\u2019s cloud. Firms can use AI technologies to collect and analyze vast amounts of data across various development platforms. There are a lot of potential solutions out there online, though \u2013 could Azure Sentinel be the right one for your organization\u2019s data security needs? When considering possible platforms to manage your data, one of the first things you should consider is cost \u2013 is this solution going to be within your budget? To answer that question, let\u2019s explore the Azure Sentinel pricing model. Exploring Azure Sentinel Pricing Options The first thing to understand about Azure Sentinel pricing is that it can be challenging to try to develop an ideal price range on the service for everyone, because every organization has different needs. The cost can also be significantly influenced by how entrenched you already are in the \u201cMicrosoft Garden\u201d of technology. You should know that if you are already using Microsoft\u2019s Azure service, the data is already there. The only new cost you would face is the price of Sentinel data analysis. What if you are not a current user of any Microsoft services? You would need to start a new Microsoft Azure subscription and set up Azure Security Center. In short, if your organization is not already reliant on Microsoft\u2019s services, the costs can be higher, with more set-up time involved. If you think your organization needs Azure Sentinel, however, you will be happy to know that there are several ways that you can choose to pay. The following options explain the Azure Sentinel pricing model: \u2022 Commitment Tiers: You will be billed at fixed rates depending on which tier you choose, and there are several to\n[5]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/billing --- Title: Plan costs for Microsoft Sentinel | Microsoft Docs --- Body: Plan costs for Microsoft Sentinel | Microsoft Docs Azure Security Microsoft Sentinel Plan costs for Microsoft Sentinel Article 04/07/2022 10 minutes to read 4 contributors In this article Free trial Identify data sources Estimate costs before using Microsoft Sentinel Understand the full billing model for Microsoft Sentinel Costs for other services Data retention and archived logs costs Other CEF ingestion costs Costs that might accrue after resource deletion Free data sources Next steps Microsoft Sentinel provides intelligent security analytics across your enterprise.

What is the Azure portal? The Azure portal is a web-based, unified console that provides an alternative to command-line tools. With the Azure portal, you can manage your Azure subscription using a graphical user interface. You can build, manage, and monitor everything from simple web apps to complex cloud deployments. Create custom dashboards for an organized view of resources. Configure accessibility options for an optimal experience. The Azure portal is designed for resiliency and continuous availability. It has a presence in every Azure datacenter. This configuration makes the Azure portal resilient to individual datacenter failures and avoids network slow-downs by being close to users. The Azure portal updates continuously and requires no downtime for maintenance activities. Azure portal menu You can choose the default mode for the portal menu. It can be docked or it can act as a flyout panel. When the portal menu is in flyout mode, it's hidden until you need it. Select the menu icon to open or close the menu. If you choose docked mode for the portal menu, it will always be visible. You can collapse the menu to provide more working space. Azure Home As a new subscriber to Azure services, the first thing you see after you sign in to the portal is Azure Home.

Some of their requirements included: A completely custom user interface served up via the Azure Portal. Integration with Azure Key Vault for certain sensitive values (e.g., passwords) so that they are not displayed, and the user cannot enter. Enforcement and validation of naming conventions on various fields, with appropriate interactive guidance and feedback. For example, all VMs must start with the letters \u201cVM_.\u201d Limitations on certain fields (e.g., regions allowed size/family of VM, etc.). Forced usage of existing VNets and resource groups. All scripts should be contained in a private GitHub repository. Ability to provide data via custom parameters on the portal interface that gets passed into a PowerShell script, which gets automatically invoked upon VM creation. An example would be allowing the user creating the VM to specify via a \u201cYes/No\u201d parameter whether Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) should be installed upon VM creation. Piecing all of these requirements together entailed stitching together a number of new (to me) technologies such as nested ARM deployments, Azure Managed Applications, etc. This article will take you though these one by one and explain some of my \u201cSchool of Hard Knocks\u201d lessons learned along the way. Custom User Interface One of the first was the custom user interface definition specification that is available as part of Azure Managed Applications. Capabilities Creating a \u201cuiFormDefinition.json\u201d file is a simple yet powerful way to provide custom user interfaces for your end users. Some of the capabilities include: Separation of your user interface into separate \u201csteps\u201d for each logical group, which manifest themselves as unique tabbed sections in the UI. For example, one step could contain all the networking configuration options available to the end user, while another the disk options. Ability to filter the available locations to only those locations that support the resource types to deploy, provide an array of the resource types.

To get around this, either A) Wait a while and try again. Once some users deallocate their N series some quota will be freed up and you can start your VM B) Spin up a new N series VM in a different Supported Region.

I wanted to create a new Storage Blob Container via PowerShell, rather than through the below process in the web portal: I looked for cmdlets which could potentially be used: Get-Command*StorageContainer* CommandType Name Version Source ----------- ---- ------- ------ Alias Get-AzureStorageContainerAcl 2.5.0 Azure.Storage Cmdlet Get-AzureStorageContainer 2.5.0 Azure.Storage Cmdlet Get-AzureStorageContainerStoredAccessPolicy 2.5.0 Azure.Storage Cmdlet New-AzureStorageContainer 2.5.0 Azure.Storage Cmdlet New-AzureStorageContainerSASToken 2.5.0 Azure.Storage Cmdlet New-AzureStorageContainerStoredAccessPolicy 2.5.0 Azure.Storage Cmdlet Remove-AzureStorageContainer 2.5.0 Azure.Storage Cmdlet Remove-AzureStorageContainerStoredAccessPolicy 2.5.0 Azure.Storage Cmdlet Set-AzureStorageContainerAcl 2.5.0 Azure.Storage Cmdlet Set-AzureStorageContainerStoredAccessPolicy 2.5.0 Azure.Storage view raw Get-Command-*StorageContainer*.ps1 hosted with by GitHub However, it returned nothing from the AzureRM module, only the Azure module.

Barbara is wondering why this would happen. There are several reasons why this situation could occur, which means that you need to do some analysis of the problem document (and Word itself) to figure out what is going on. If the problem occurs in only one document or with some occurrences of misspelled words in a particular document, then that means that the problem is with the document itself. The most common reason is that the text has somehow been formatted so that Word ignores it when checking spelling or grammar. You can find out if this is the case by first selecting the word that was missed during the spell check. Then display the Review tab of the ribbon and, in the Proofing group, click on Set Language. Word displays the Language dialog box. Look at the Do Not Check Spelling or Grammar check box to see if it contains a check mark. If the setting is turned on, then Word ignores the selected text when checking either spelling or grammar. Don't change the setting yet; you still have some detective work to figure out the actual problem. Go ahead and dismiss the Language dialog box for now. You now need to figure out how pervasive the \"no proofing\" or \"do not check\" setting is within the document. First check to see if this setting is related to whatever style is used to format the selected text. (How you check style settings has been covered in other issues of WordTips.) If the setting is made in the style, then any other text formatted with that style in the document is also skipped during a spelling check. The solution, in that case, is to either use a different style that allows the proofing or change the style so that the style permits proofing. If the setting is not made in the style, then that means that someone specifically turned off the proofing for the particular text. While you can explicitly change it for this particular instance of the word, you might need to change it a lot of other\n[4]: URL: https://azurelessons.com/az-account-show --- Title: Az Account Show - Azure Lessons --- Body: Az Account Show - Azure Lessons az account show March 1, 2022 by Rajkishore In this Azure tutorial, we will discuss az account show.

As such, I wanted to take the opportunity to talk about some underlying causes of what is perhaps the most common of all PowerShell errors. \u2018Term not recognized\u2019 The simplest and yet one of the most common of all PowerShell errors states that a term is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. The error goes on to say that you should check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included to verify that the path is correct and try again. You can see an example of this error in the figure below. Spelling errors There are three main causes for this error (and several other causes related to the three main causes). As you may have already gathered, the most common cause is simply misspelling the name of the cmdlet. (This is, obviously, one of the main causes for all PowerShell errors.) In the screen capture, for instance, I intentionally misspelled the Get-Help cmdlet. As such, if you get this particular error, then you should always begin the troubleshooting process by checking your spelling. Path errors A second reason why this error message happens is because you are using an incorrect path. On my computer, for example, I have a folder named C:\\Scripts, and that folder contains a number of different PowerShell scripts, including a script called Calendar.ps1 that displays a graphical calendar that was created using PowerShell. If I were to navigate to the C:\\Scripts folder and launch the calendar script, then the script runs as expected. If I try executing the script from the root folder (without specifying a path), however, then I receive an error message as shown below. Keep in mind that the same thing can also happen if you try to call an external function without specifying a path. Speaking of functions, there are situations in which a call to a function can trigger this error, even if the function exists\n", "messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!

We can do this if the device is auto enrolled to Intune MDM when joined however this deploys the \"Intune Mobile Client\" which we don't want to use. If we disable auto enrolment and Azure AD join a windows device it defaults to saying that \"your organisation required windows hello\". I can therefore only assume that the setting enforcing the use of windows hello is being managed from within Azure AD and not InTune as Intune is set to disabled. Anyone know how you can disable windows hello in Azure AD?

Okta MFA can be used in the following use-cases: You want Okta to handle the MFA requirements for an MFA prompt triggered by Azure AD Conditional access for your domain federated with Okta. You can use Okta MFA to enroll your end users into Windows Hello for Business so that they can use a single MFA solution for both Okta and Microsoft MFA needs. Known issues Users can enter infinite sign-in loop End users can enter an infinite sign-in loop when Okta app-level sign-on policy is weaker than the Azure AD policy. This can happen in the following scenarios: App-level sign-on policy doesn't require MFA In this case, Okta does not prompt the user for MFA when accessing the app. However, Azure AD Conditional Access requires MFA and expects Okta to pass the completed MFA claim. Consequently, the user gets stuck in the infinite authentication loop. Okta may still prompt for MFA if it is configured at the org-level but that MFA claim won't be passed to Azure AD. App-level sign-on policy doesn\u2019t require MFA when the user signs in from an \"In Zone\" network but requires MFA when the user signs in from a network that is \"Not in Zone\" In this case, if the user is signing in from a network that\u2019s In Zone, he or she will not be prompted for the MFA. However, Azure AD Conditional Access requires MFA and expects Okta to pass the completed MFA claim. Consequently, the user gets stuck in the infinite authentication loop. Temporary support for org-level MFA You can temporarily use the org-level MFA for the purpose of this procedure, if: you\u2019re migrating your org from Classic Engine to Identity Engine, and the org-level sign-on policy requires MFA. However, we strongly recommend you set up an app-level Office 365 sign on policy to enforce MFA to use in this procedure. Before you begin Configure MFA in Okta: Configure an app sign on policy for your WS-Federation Office 365 app instance as described in Authentication policies.

One factor being some kind of local gesture such as a PIN, fingerprint or facial recognition, and the other being a key or certificate that is bound to the device itself. When you do as you\u2019re supposed to, and join PC\u2019s to Azure AD rather than a local / legacy Active Directory, Windows Hello for Business is setup for you auto-magically. No special infrastructure or certificates, no federated services or other junk. It just works. This is on by default for Microsoft 365 subscriptions that include Intune. So when a computer is joined to Azure AD and enrolled for MDM, one of the first things that a new user will be prompted to do is setup their Hello PIN on their Windows 10 device. If you go look in the Intune portal, you will find some settings for controlling Windows Hello for Business under Device enrollment > Windows enrollment > Windows Hello for Business. That\u2019s all fine and good\u2026 unless you aren\u2019t doing as you\u2019re supposed to. If you are one of those poor souls still joining their PC\u2019s to a traditional Active Directory domain, then you\u2019re going to run into a problem with these default Hello settings when you go to enroll your \u201chybrid-joined\u201d devices for MDM. While a \u201chybrid-joined\u201d user will still get prompted to create a PIN, they will immediately discover that they cannot actually use it. They might see a message like: Windows couldn\u2019t sign you in. Your credentials could not be verified. The same thing will happen for facial recognition or fingerprint. Bummer. The reason is because Windows Hello for Business is disabled by default on domain-joined computers. If you want to setup Windows Hello for Business in a hybrid environment, there is a whole bunch of technical stuff required before it\u2019s ready to rock. And it\u2019s not a breezy process, either.

This is a very reasonable alternative for most of developers that are starting with containers and want to begin their journey with containers. If you haven\u2019t read my previous article, you can find it here: Kubernetes vs Azure Service Fabric DISCLAIMER Some parts of this article do not apply to Azure App Service for Windows or Linux without containers. Azure App Service vs other stuff Neither AKS nor Service Fabric is a \u201cfully managed\u201d service. Azure gives you SLA only on the underlying virtual machine infrastructure. This means that neither Kubernetes, nor Service Fabric will give you guarantee that your applications still work after any cluster-level failure. I will not go into detail what a cluster-level failure means for me, but I can tell you there is a lot that can happen when you orchestrate tens/hundreds of containers on a set of predefined machines. This also means that you need an automation system in place, in case of a failure. Sometimes you even need a dedicated team of engineers, that monitors your cluster 24/7. There are many intricacies and nuances of running a Kubernetes cluster. The amount of effort to prepare and maintain a Kubernetes environment is non-trivial. Side note I believe there are exceptions to these rules. Small clusters that are not mission-critical are also a viable option for small businesses. I had been running production workloads without any interruption for almost half a year on a small Kubernetes cluster. It all depends on what a production-ready cluster is for you. App Service for Linux - the good parts Azure App Service for Linux is much easier to manage than Kubernetes and Service Fabric. It is a fully managed service, which means that there is an SLA guarantee on your application working in the environment. Azure App Service is easy to scale. You get automatic scaling, such as by CPU usage, out-of-the-box.

The comparisons are only approximate but representative of the underlying cost structure. Unless there are hard Windows server dependencies, switching to AKS will save 30%+ and AKS is fully supported by Microsoft tools like Visual Studio and Azure DevOps. Cost Comparison between Azure Kubernetes vs. App Services A few other notes and interesting facts uncovered while working on this cost analysis: The discount between Monthly and Dev/Test VM pricing appears to be the license cost of Windows server. Linux VMs pricing is the same as Windows Dev/Test pricing and there is no additional discount. AKS does not support the instance sizes of the smallest App Service Plans. The documentation of the instance sizes used is for the Premium v2 tier. Only the Premium Tier of App Service Plans has SSD storage. App Service does support Linux but with only 5% discount over Windows Lack of equivalents for App Service Storage sizes in AKS and VM \u2014 next highest size was selected Pricing represents a single instance and would rise as instances are added to the App Service plans or AKS clusters Price savings of AKS over equivalent App Service Plans increases with higher App Service Plan Tiers Cost of AKS nodes similar to cost of VMs running Linux but there is a small discount with D_v2 instances Syntax of Node column in the table is \u201cinstance type\u201d + \u201cstorage type\u201d: storage size No pricing for Windows containers under AKS until GA App Services are legacy technology for Microsoft Azure \u2014 no major announcements or blog posts since 2017. 3 3 More from Nature of Clouds Reflections on the fundamental nature of cloud computing and open source\n[3]: URL: https://sourceforge.net/software/compare/azure-app-service-vs-azure-kubernetes-service-aks-vs-github-vs-github-copilot --- Title: Azure App Service vs. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) vs ... --- Body: Azure App Service vs. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) vs. GitHub vs. GitHub Copilot Comparison Azure App Service vs. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) vs. GitHub vs. GitHub Copilot Comparison Chart Azure App Service Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Microsoft GitHub GitHub Copilot GitHub Learn More Update Features Learn More Update Features Learn More Update Features Learn More Update Features Platforms Supported Windows Mac Linux SaaS iPhone iPad Android Platforms Supported Windows Mac Linux SaaS iPhone iPad Android Platforms Supported Windows Mac Linux SaaS iPhone iPad Android Platforms Supported Windows Mac Linux SaaS iPhone iPad Android Audience DevOps teams that want to build, deploy, and scale web apps and APIs Audience Companies that want a fully managed Kubernetes service on Azure to deploy and manage containerized applications Audience Software developers Audience Developers that want an AI coding assistant to help them write code Support Business Hours 24/7 Live Support Online Support Business Hours 24/7 Live Support Online Support Business Hours 24/7 Live Support Online Support Business Hours 24/7 Live Support Online Screenshots and Videos View more images or videos Screenshots and Videos View more images or videos Screenshots and Videos View more images or videos Screenshots and Videos View more images or videos Pricing $0.013 per hour Free Version Free Trial Pricing No info rmation available.

Here are some key points to consider when comparing Azure App Service for Windows and Linux:\n\n1. Operating System: The main difference between Azure App Service for Windows and Linux is the underlying operating system. Windows App Service runs on Windows operating system, while Linux App Service runs on Linux.\n\n2. Language Support: Azure App Service supports multiple programming languages, including .NET, Java, Python, Node.js, PHP, and Ruby. Windows App Service has broader language support, including .NET and PHP, while Linux App Service provides better support for open-source languages like Python and Node.js.\n\n3. Containerization: Both Windows and Linux App Service support containerization. However, Linux App Service is often preferred for containerized applications as it provides better integration with Docker and Kubernetes.\n\n4. SLA Guarantee: Azure App Service offers a Service Level Agreement (SLA) guarantee for the underlying virtual machine infrastructure, ensuring reliability and availability. This guarantee applies to both Windows and Linux App Service.\n\n5. Auto Scaling: Azure App Service provides automatic scaling capabilities based on CPU or other metrics, allowing applications to handle increased traffic without manual intervention.

Applications will send messages that may be stored on the local machine or delivered to a Syslog collector. When the Log Analytics agent for Linux is installed, it configures the local Syslog daemon to forward messages to the agent. The agent then sends the message to Azure Monitor where a corresponding record is created. Important This article covers collecting Syslog events with the Log Analytics agent which is one of the agents used by Azure Monitor. Other agents collect different data and are configured differently. See Overview of Azure Monitor agents for a list of the available agents and the data they can collect. Note Azure Monitor supports collection of messages sent by rsyslog or syslog-ng, where rsyslog is the default daemon. The default syslog daemon on version 5 of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, and Oracle Linux version (sysklog) is not supported for syslog event collection. To collect syslog data from this version of these distributions, the rsyslog daemon should be installed and configured to replace sysklog. The following facilities are supported with the Syslog collector: kern user mail daemon auth syslog lpr news uucp cron authpriv ftp local0-local7 For any other facility, configure a Custom Logs data source in Azure Monitor. Configuring Syslog The Log Analytics agent for Linux will only collect events with the facilities and severities that are specified in its configuration. You can configure Syslog through the Azure portal or by managing configuration files on your Linux agents. Configure Syslog in the Azure portal Configure Syslog from the Agent configuration menu for the Log Analytics workspace. This configuration is delivered to the configuration file on each Linux agent. You can add a new facility by clicking Add facility. For each facility, only messages with the selected severities will be collected. Check the severities for the particular facility that you want to collect. You cannot provide any additional criteria to filter messages. By default, all configuration changes are automatically pushed to all agents. If you want to configure Syslog manually on each Linux agent,\n[2]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/connect-syslog --- Title: Connect Syslog data to Azure Sentinel | Microsoft Docs --- Body: Connect Syslog data to Microsoft Sentinel | Microsoft Docs Azure Security Microsoft Sentinel Collect data from Linux-based sources using Syslog Article 04/06/2022 8 minutes to read 10 contributors In this article Architecture Configure your Linux machine or appliance Configure your device's logging settings Configure the Log Analytics agent Find your data Next steps Note Azure Sentinel is now called Microsoft Sentinel, and we\u2019ll be updating these pages in the coming weeks. Learn more about recent Microsoft security enhancements. Note For information about feature availability in US Government clouds, see the Microsoft Sentinel tables in Cloud feature availability for US Government customers. Syslog is an event logging protocol that is common to Linux. You can use the Syslog daemon built into Linux devices and appliances to collect local events of the types you specify, and have it send those events to Microsoft Sentinel using the Log Analytics agent for Linux (formerly known as the OMS agent). This article describes how to connect your data sources to Microsoft Sentinel using Syslog. For more information about supported connectors for this method, see Data connectors reference. Architecture When the Log Analytics agent is installed on your VM or appliance, the installation script configures the local Syslog daemon to forward messages to the agent on UDP port 25224. After receiving the messages, the agent sends them to your Log Analytics workspace over HTTPS, where they are ingested into the Syslog table in Microsoft Sentinel > Logs. For more information, see Syslog data sources in Azure Monitor. For some device types that don't allow local installation of the Log Analytics agent, the agent can be installed instead on a dedicated Linux-based log forwarder. The originating device must be configured to send Syslog events to the Syslog daemon on this forwarder instead of the local daemon. The Syslog daemon on the forwarder sends events to the Log Analytics agent over UDP. If this Linux forwarder is expected to collect a high volume of Syslog events, its Syslog daemon sends events to the agent over TCP instead. In either case, the agent then sends the events from there to your Log Analytics workspace in Microsoft Sentinel. Note If your appliance supports Common Event Format (CEF) over Syslog, a more complete data set is collected, and the data is parsed at collection. You should choose this option and follow the instructions in Get CEF-formatted logs from your device or\n[3]: URL: https://accountabilit.com/azure-log-analytics-best-syslog-destination --- Title: Azure Log Analytics: The Best \u2018Syslog\u2019 Destination ... --- Body: Azure Log Analytics: The Best \u2018Syslog\u2019 Destination - AccountabilIT Azure Log Analytics: The Best \u2018Syslog\u2019 Destination A common business requirement of many enterprises is the forwarding, collection, and analysis of syslog messages. In practical terms, this means central event log storage and processing for most all network gear except Microsoft Windows Server and applications which have the Event Log service. Using a syslog server as a collection point for logging activities allows all network logs to be stored in one place so they can be searched easily. A syslog collection facility is a must for network security because without a syslog server, logs remain on scattered devices and can never be reviewed or archived. All Linux and UNIX servers have syslog capability and most networking gear such as Cisco routers, Check Point and Juniper firewalls, and F5 \u201cBIGIP\u201d load balancers can be configured to generate and forward syslog messages as well. And while a central syslog server is a good idea, a management burden emerges as the enterprise grows since a single server destination can quickly have capacity and performance issues. Azure Log Analytics: Purpose built for high volume event processing The Log Analytics service in Azure ingests and processes high volume event and security log information from Windows and Linux computers running OMS Agents. Syslog is the cross-platform equivalent of Windows Event Log, and by leveraging Azure Log Analytics you can collect and surface your Windows and non-Windows event data in a holistic fashion. That includes messages from network devices that can forward syslog via Linux computers. Microsoft\u2019s Azure public cloud service includes a Log Analytics service which combined with the Microsoft Operations Management Suite (OMS) repository and OMS alerting features is a valid enterprise approach to syslog management. Figure 1 illustrates how one or more Linux VMs with OMS Agents forward the syslog messages of network devices to OMS Log Analytics, where the data is searchable by using the OMS portal, the OMS mobile app, or other programmatic access. Figure 1 \u2013 A five-server Linux VM syslog forwarder farm in a large-enterprise attach model What are syslogs and what use can they be? A syslog message is an event, a log entry either routine or urgent, from a device or computer.

How can I assist you today?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is syslog server azure ?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Syslog server Azure refers to the capability of Azure Monitor to collect and store syslog data from Linux-based sources. Syslog is an event logging protocol commonly used in Linux environments. With Azure Monitor, you can use the Log Analytics agent to configure the local syslog daemon on Linux machines to forward syslog messages to Azure Monitor. These messages are then sent to Azure Monitor where corresponding records are created [[1]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/data-sources-syslog)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you please provide me the steps for syslog server azure ?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! Here are the steps to configure a syslog server in Azure Monitor:\n\n1. Install the Log Analytics agent for Linux on your Linux machine or appliance.\n\n2. Configure the syslog daemon on your Linux machine to forward messages to the Log Analytics agent on UDP port 25224.\n\n3. After receiving the messages, the Log Analytics agent sends them to your Log Analytics workspace over HTTPS.\n\n4. In your Log Analytics workspace, the syslog messages are ingested into the Syslog table in Azure Monitor > Logs.\n\n5. You can then use log queries in Azure Monitor to analyze and search the syslog data.\n\nPlease note that these steps provide a high-level overview and more detailed instructions can be found in the Azure Monitor documentation [[[2]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/connect-syslog)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/connect-syslog).\n\nLet me know if you need any more information!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Merits of syslog server azure"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are several merits to using a syslog server in Azure Monitor:\n\n1. Centralized event logging: By configuring a syslog server in Azure Monitor, you can collect and store syslog data from multiple Linux-based sources in a centralized location. This makes it easier to search and analyze the data.\n\n2. Scalability: Azure Monitor is designed to handle high volumes of event data. With a syslog server in Azure Monitor, you can easily scale your logging infrastructure to handle increasing data volumes as your organization grows.\n\n3. Security and compliance: By storing syslog data in Azure Monitor, you can take advantage of Azure's security features and compliance certifications. Azure provides robust security controls and compliance frameworks to help protect your syslog data.\n\n4.

Are the answers below sorted in a way that puts the best answer at or near the top? Take a short survey 2 The best in Powershell scripting is AZ (azure CLI) because it optimizes powershell scripting(from scratch) The best in any form is ARM templates (.json) because it is intelligent when updating an existing infra(it wont remove existing but adds missing). Thus it beats AZ but sometimes AZ contributes to ARM templates(eg: some features are missing). Azure automation helps schedule tasks: eg: Dev machine should run 12 hours. create PowerShell workflow scripts and then bind them to two azure automation schedules (start + stop) DSC is a PowerShell feature that prevents configuration drift. eg: Deploy a DSC configuration that prevents server services from stopping. Most of the time there are limited options to choose from(4 options) eg: to Create a Virtual Network these are the options: Use Portal Use Powershell Use Azure CLI Json ARM template Edited in 2020 as requested: IAC(infrastructure as code) is the defacto nowadays and companies either choose ARM templates or Terraform(or similar). When using Terraform, the compatibility with arm templates could become an issue. I use 80% powershell with AZ(mainly because VM is involved) and 20% ARM templates. The problem then is losing idempotence. So a developer need to know which commands are idempotent. This leads to arm template inheritance and such design\n[3]: URL: https://azureguru.org/azure-cli-vs-azure-powershell --- Title: \ue000Azure CLI vs Azure Powershell\ue001 | AzureGuru - You can be an ... --- Body: Azure CLI vs Azure Powershell | AzureGuru - You can be an Azure master Azure CLI vs Azure Powershell By Reynard from AzureGuru Published in AZ-900 Training October 20, 2020 1 min read *This article could be a summary of content for learning purposes. For more information and knowledge, read the original articles in the References section. Azure CLI is a cross-platform command-line program that connects to Azure and executes administrative commands on Azure resources. Cross platform means that it can be run on Windows, Linux, or macOS. Azure PowerShell is a module that you add to Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Core that enables you to connect to your Azure subscription and manage resources. Azure PowerShell requires Windows PowerShell to function. PowerShell provides services such as the shell window and command parsing. Azure PowerShell then adds the Azure-specific commands. However, the Azure PowerShell and Azure CLI commands have different syntax. For example, Azure PowerShell provides the New-AzVM command that creates a virtual machine for you inside your Azure subscription while to create a Virtual Machine using Azure CLI you must use the command az vm create.

Before we talk about Azure PowerShell vs Azure CLI, first of all, we need a bit of background. Both are available in the Azure cloud or you can use them remotely from your workstation. On your workstation, you will have to install a module, which we will explain later, but both are available in Azure Cloud Shell. Azure CLI is short for the Azure command-line interface. In Azure, at the top of your screen in the middle, you have an icon for a command prompt. When you click on that icon, you will enter Azure Cloud Shell. You will have a choice then to choose between PowerShell or Bash. If you wish to manage Windows-based VMs, you will choose PowerShell; on the other hand, if you want to manage Linux VMs, Bash is the option you need. Bash is a Unix shell that was invented in 1989, while PowerShell was invented in 2006. Both Bash and PowerShell are scripting languages. This simply means that they are already compiled code that issues commands to the OS. Bash issues commands to form strings, while PowerShell forms objects. With that said, you then have Azure CLI, which is used to issue a set of commands to add, delete, or modify resources in Azure. By that, I mean the actual Azure resources and not the operating system that resides on the resources. Azure CLI is available in both the Bash and PowerShell sections of Azure Cloud Shell.

Have you looked at ARM templates and thought, whoa, looks complex? Because many people complained about the difficulty of building ARM templates, Microsoft developed a layer of abstraction called Azure Bicep. In this tutorial, you will learn how to get started from scratch. You\u2019ll learn how to do everything from setting up a development environment to deploying your first Bicep template! Let\u2019s get started! Prerequisites This tutorial will be a hands-on demonstration. If you\u2019d like to follow along, be sure you have the following: Windows 10 \u2013 The majority of the demos in this tutorial will work on other operating systems but all demos will use Windows 10. Visual Studio Code \u2013 This tutorial will use v1.60.2. An Azure Resource Group to deploy to \u2013 This tutorial will use a resource group called ATA. What is Azure Bicep? Bicep is a domain-specific language that makes building ARM templates easier. You can think of Bicep as an abstraction layer on top of ARM templates. ARM uses JSON and can get complex, especially for large deployments. Microsoft decided to create Bicep to reduce the complexities and improve the development experience. It is not a new language; think of it more as an improvement to the JSON ARM templates. Setting Up a Bicep Development Environment To start developing Bicep templates, you need to set up an environment that will help you get the best results. To do that, you have a few tools at your disposal. Let\u2019s first set up the environment you need including the VS Code Bicep extension, the Bicep CLI, and optionally the Azure PowerShell modules. Installing the VS Code Bicep Extension VS Code is a great development tool to build Bicep templates. As such, Microsoft provides a VS Code extension to help make creating Bicep templates easier. Let\u2019s start building a development environment by prepping VS Code. Open Visual Studio Code and click on the Extensions button. Opening extensions In the search bar, type \u201cbicep\u201d. You should see a single Bicep extension appear. When this happens, click on Install. After a few moments, VS Code will install the Bicep extension. Search and install bicep extension Even though the next section will give you the Bicep template to copy/paste, you\u2019ll undoubtedly have times when you need to create Bicep templates from scratch.

Also to this sample and method call. For other languages take a look at Microsoft-supported client libraries. The only requirement for your Angular application is to get an access token for your API first that can be used as assertion. If you're talking about user impersonation from the Angular application (that is user impersonating another one) that's not supported out of the box, you would need to store the user credentials securily in your API with something like Key Vault so that you can request a new access token using ROPC.

It tracks and manages users with a local account and as many external accounts as you want. This should get you going in the right direction if not solve the issue for you. However, if you want to impersonate a different user that is logged in (for debugging, for instance), that's for you to implement. Here's a way: When you authenticate with an external provider the user is redirected back to your controller (to an action usually in AccountController called external login or something). This action, by default, will Sign the user in with claims information from the external provider.

Back then, I was not able to access the Rest API provided. A service tag represents a group of IP address prefixes from a given Azure service. This week I revisited the API and dived a little deeper into this call. In this blog, I show you how to read service tags using the Azure Rest API and we learn how to cope with the bearer token if we want to access the Access API. I show it both in Postman and using C# code. The call we need to execute for the service tags is this GET method: GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Network/locations/{location}/serviceTags?api-version=2020-04-01 We have to fill in the subscription Id GUID (which is available in your Azure subscription) and the region/location (eg. \u2018westeurope\u2019). When I execute this, I get this exception message: {\"error\":{\"code\":\"AuthenticationFailed\",\"message\":\"Authentication failed. The 'Authorization' header is missing.\"}} OK, this means I have to authenticate against my Azure subscription. As documented, I have to make use of the \u2018Azure Active Directory OAuth2 Flow\u2019 because we have to do some impersonation. It was not directly clear to me how to create a security context that I could pass on to this service tags call. Luckily, I got some help from this documentation. A bearer token is the solution. How do we get an Azure bearer token? It starts with executing this Azure CLI command: az login az ad sp create-for-rbac -n \"testaccount\" This gives you a (new) service principal with an tennant, app id and password: Note: You can choose your own name. Note: Each time you execute this call, a new password is generated for the same service principal. The result of this call is an \u2018app\u2019 being a contributer inside your subscription: Note: You can take away the access rights by simply removing this app registration. Now we have an Azure service principal, we can fill in all security information into this call body which will give us the needed bearer token: POST https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantid}/oauth2/token Note: You have to fill in your tenantid again.

While this works, it's time consuming and requires manual steps and verification to make sure all the security of our user record matches to that of the end user. In addition, you would need to coordinate with your system administrator to add your security role back when the configuration/troubleshooting is complete. This process could be simplified by impersonating the end user without having to meddle with the security roles and appropriate configurations of your own user. Let's look at how we can accomplish this. The official documentation explains the impersonation process for both the preferred and legacy approach. In this blog we will look at the Preferred approach. The same could however be applied to the legacy approach. 1. Add the security privilege on your user account to enable Impersonation We need to make sure our user account has the prvActOnBehalfOfAnotherUser privilege. This is also included in the 'Delegate' security role. 2. Get the Azure AD Object ID of the user We need to Azure AD Object ID of the end user we are trying to impersonate.This could be retrieved using advanced find and adding this column to the desired user Azure Active Directory Object Id for system user Copy the Azure AD Object ID for the user which we will use in the next step. In the example below I have choosen a Test User record Azure AD Object ID from advanced find 3. Install ModHeader or similar extension in your browser I'm currently using Chrome and ModHeader extension for this blog but you can choose your preferred extensions which has the ability to add Request headers. Every operation made in Dynamics 365 in the web client is sent as a HTTP request to perform operations(create, update, retrieve etc.). Extensions like ModHeader inject a request header in the browser before sending it to the server. As explained in the documentation we would need to set the CallerObjectId request header to impersonate the user. Setting the CallerObjectId header value in ModHeader Now refresh the page you should see Dynamics 365 in the context of the user you are impersonating.\n[5]: URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/questions/125001/impersonating-a-user-from-azure-ad-b2c.html --- Title: Impersonating a user from Azure AD B2C - Microsoft Q&A --- Body: Impersonating a user from Azure AD B2C - Microsoft Q&A question 1 emctradr-5401 asked \u2022 Oct 13 2020 at 5:43 AM|DaeraSererc-9397 answered \u2022 Mar 17 2021 at 2:43 AM Impersonating a user from Azure AD B2C Is there a way to have like a super admin account that can impersonate or access a secured website/web api on behalf of another user?

We sync AD on-prem to Azure AD, but found nested AD groups either not sync'd or not taking effect when nested inside another AD group. Here is what we found - AD group A is inside AD group B, a user is member of Group A, Group B is assigned permission in SharePoint Online. But the user does not get the access to SharePoint Online.

I can assign users and AD groups to those roles. However, when I want to assign a group to a role, it works only when a user is a direct member of the group. If, for instance, I add the whole group STUD to a role, it does not work with role assignment. Therefore I have to add all the single nested roles to the role, which is quite time consuming. But that would have been acceptable as one-time-solution. Bad thing is, there are new groups and users constantly. And I'd have to keep the role assignments up-to-date manually all the time.

Question Can we use a nested Azure AD group for assigning Intune Application Protection (AKA MAM-WE) policies? Answer Short version: Yes, but give it a little thought first Long version: I was asked this one recently and I wasn\u2019t certain but thought it would most likely work. I set up an example where I had an on-premises Active Directory user named PeterOP, I added that user to an on-premises Active Directory security group which was then synchronised to Azure Active Directory with Azure AD Connect. The AD group was called MyAPPTest. I then added that group to an Azure AD group called Android App Protection as you can see in the image. So we have an on-prem user inside an on-prem AD group which is nested inside an Azure AD group. The App Protection policy is then assigned to the AAD group \u2013 Android App Protection Then I simply test by opening an application which is protected by this policy, in this case on a personal device. Then I log in as PeterOP \u2013 my on-premises AD user. On the device I see the regular prompts about the app being protected etc and it just works fine. We can see this in the report through the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center. Note that I only actually tried Word and Outlook in this test as that sufficiently confirmed my test result. Should we use this though? Great question, I\u2019m glad you asked :). We can see that although it does work, it may become somewhat convoluted and complicated as this scales out across a real-world organisation. I\u2019m just using a simple targeted demo here and there\u2019s a level of comprehension required to keep up with the nesting. With that in mind I\u2019d generally try and steer you away from using nested groups in this scenario and indeed others for this reason. Note however, that although this works for App Protection I can\u2019t say it will work for all features as I know that nested groups are not supported in all areas of Azure Active Directory or Intune/Endpoint Manager. In particular, group-based licensing often comes up as a requirement and\n[5]: URL: https://community.zscaler.com/t/azure-ad-nested-group-not-synced-in-zscaler-group/9092 --- Title: \ue000Azure\ue001 \ue000AD Nested Group not synced in ZScaler group\ue001 - Zenith --- Body: Azure AD Nested Group not synced in ZScaler group - Authentication - Zenith Azure AD Nested Group not synced in ZScaler group Authentication user-group mahesh_kulkarni(mahesh kulkarni) October 2, 2020, 2:24pm #1 In ZScaler ZSCloud, SAML is used for authentication users with Azure AD as IdP.

Nested groups in Azure AD can be useful for organizing and managing access permissions within your organization. However, there are some considerations and limitations to be aware of.\n\nAccording to Microsoft [[1]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-groups-membership-azure-portal), nested groups are currently supported both in cloud and hybrid configurations. This means that you can create nested groups in Azure AD and synchronize them from on-premises Active Directory. However, it's important to note that there have been some issues reported with nested groups not syncing or not taking effect in certain scenarios.\n\nFor example, one user reported that a user who was a member of a nested group did not get access to SharePoint Online even though the nested group was assigned permissions. Microsoft acknowledged this issue and stated that nested groups are currently not supported in Azure AD [[1]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-groups-membership-azure-portal). However, another user mentioned that nested groups are supported and provided syntax examples for using them [[1]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-groups-membership-azure-portal).\n\nIn another discussion on Stack Overflow [[2]](https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/questions/170164/nested-ad-groups-not-working-in-azure-ad.html), a user mentioned that assigning roles to nested groups in Azure AD's enterprise applications only works if the user is a direct member of the group. This means that if you want to assign a role to a nested group, you would need to manually add all the individual nested roles to the role, which can be time-consuming and not scalable.\n\nSimilarly, in an article on Octopus Deploy [[3]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/directory-service-limits-restrictions), it was mentioned that Azure AD and nested groups may not work correctly, and the current workaround is to either have everything on one domain or un-nest the groups.\n\nOverall, while nested groups can be used in Azure AD, there are limitations and potential issues to consider. It's recommended to carefully test and evaluate the behavior of nested groups in your specific scenarios to ensure they function as expected.\n\nI hope this information helps!

And now Microsoft has made available a preview of \u201cFilters for devices\u201d for use in your Azure AD Conditional Access policies. Because this functionality is provided as a preview there is no service level agreement (SLA), and therefore Microsoft doesn\u2019t recommend to implement its functionality for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities Filters for devices are available as conditions which you can use when creating your Conditional Access policies, with this functionality you can include or exclude devices based on filters using a rule expression. Combining include and exclude is not supported. Filters for devices (Preview) Microsoft provides the following examples where filters might provide a solution in their documentation: Give access to Azure Management for privileged users only, coming from privileged or secure admin workstations Block access from devices running non supported Windows versions (like Windows 7, 8.1) Do not require MFA for specific account (traditional AD service accounts) when used on specific devices, like Teams phones or Surface Hub devices The documentation states that Device state (which allows you to exclude Compliant and/or Azure AD Hybrid joined devices) and Filters for devices cannot be used in one Conditional Access policy. You can use the Compliancy and Azure AD Hybrid joined status in the Filter for devices as well though using the trustType and/or isCompliant properties, so basically this means that the Device State condition might disappear in the future to be replaced by the Filters for devices functionality. Under the Filters for devices the following attributes can be used: deviceId, displayName, manufacurer, mdmAppId, model, operatingSystem, operatingSystemVersion, physicalIds, profileType, systemLabels, trustType Besides these attributes also custom attributes which can be set on the device in the form of extensionAttribute can be used, for this 15 custom fields can be used.

A Conditional Access policy brings signals together, to make decisions, and enforce organizational policies. How does an organization create these policies? What is required? How are they applied? Multiple Conditional Access policies may apply to an individual user at any time. In this case, all policies that apply must be satisfied. For example, if one policy requires multi-factor authentication (MFA) and another requires a compliant device, you must complete MFA, and use a compliant device. All assignments are logically ANDed. If you've more than one assignment configured, all assignments must be satisfied to trigger a policy. If a policy where \"Require one of the selected controls\" is selected, we prompt in the order defined, as soon as the policy requirements are satisfied, access is granted. All policies are enforced in two phases: Phase 1: Collect session details Gather session details, like network location and device identity that will be necessary for policy evaluation. Phase 1 of policy evaluation occurs for enabled policies and policies in report-only mode. Phase 2: Enforcement Use the session details gathered in phase 1 to identify any requirements that haven't been met. If there's a policy that is configured to block access, with the block grant control, enforcement will stop here and the user will be blocked. The user will be prompted to complete more grant control requirements that weren't satisfied during phase 1 in the following order, until policy is satisfied: Multi-factor authentication\u200b Approved client app/app protection policy\u200b Managed device (compliant or hybrid Azure AD join)\u200b Terms of use Custom controls Once all grant controls have been satisfied, apply session controls (App Enforced, Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, and token Lifetime) Phase 2 of policy evaluation occurs for all enabled policies. Assignments The assignments portion controls the who, what, and where of the Conditional Access policy. Users and groups Users and groups assign who the policy will include or exclude. This assignment can include all users, specific groups of users, directory roles, or external guest users.

Here are some general best practices to consider:\n\n1. Be descriptive: Use clear and meaningful names that accurately reflect the purpose and scope of the policy. For example, \"Block access from non-compliant devices\" or \"Require MFA for privileged users.\"\n\n2. Use a standardized format: Establish a naming pattern that includes relevant information such as the target application/service, user/group, and access requirements. This can help easily identify and categorize policies. For example, \"<Application/Service> - <User/Group> - <Access Requirement>.\"\n\n3. Keep it concise: While it's important to provide enough information, try to keep the names concise to avoid unnecessary complexity. Use abbreviations or acronyms where appropriate, but ensure they are clear and easily understood.\n\n4. Separate elements with hyphens or underscores: Hyphens or underscores can be used to visually separate different elements in the policy name. This improves readability and makes it easier to parse information.\n\n5.

Establish trust: Create a trust relationship between the directories to enable cross-tenant collaboration. This can be done using Azure AD Connect and federation technologies like Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS).\n\n3. Map and migrate users, groups, and resources: Determine how users, groups, and resources will be mapped and migrated from the source tenant to the target tenant. This may involve using scripts, tools like Azure AD Connect, or manual processes.\n\n4. Configure permissions and access controls: Review and configure the necessary permissions and access controls in the target tenant to ensure users have the appropriate access to resources and applications.\n\n5. Test and validate: Perform thorough testing to ensure that the merging process has been successful. Validate that all users, groups, and resources have been migrated correctly and that access is working as expected.\n\n6. Communicate and educate: Inform users and stakeholders about the merging process, any changes in access or permissions, and provide training or documentation as needed.\n\n7. Monitor and resolve issues: Continuously monitor the tenants post-merge for any issues, such as authentication or access problems.

These best practices are derived from our experience with Azure AD RBAC and the experiences of customers like yourself. We encourage you to also read our detailed security guidance at Securing privileged access for hybrid and cloud deployments in Azure AD. 1. Manage to least privilege When planning your access control strategy, it's a best practice to manage to least privilege. Least privilege means you grant your administrators exactly the permission they need to do their job. There are three aspects to consider when you assign a role to your administrators: a specific set of permissions, over a specific scope, for a specific period of time. Avoid assigning broader roles at broader scopes even if it initially seems more convenient to do so. By limiting roles and scopes, you limit what resources are at risk if the security principal is ever compromised. Azure AD RBAC supports over 65 built-in roles. There are Azure AD roles to manage directory objects like users, groups, and applications, and also to manage Microsoft 365 services like Exchange, SharePoint, and Intune. To better understand Azure AD built-in roles, see Understand roles in Azure Active Directory. If there isn't a built-in role that meets your need, you can create your own custom roles. Finding the right roles Follow these steps to help you find the right role. Sign in to the Azure portal or Azure AD admin center. Select Azure Active Directory > Roles and administrators to see the list of Azure AD roles. Use the Service filter to narrow down the list of roles. Refer to the Azure AD built-in roles documentation.

These resources include resources in Azure AD, Azure, and other Microsoft Online Services such as Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Intune. The following video introduces you to important PIM concepts and features. What is Azure Active Directory Privileged Identity Management? Watch on Reasons to use Organizations want to minimize the number of people who have access to secure information or resources, because that reduces the chance of a malicious actor getting access an authorized user inadvertently impacting a sensitive resource However, users still need to carry out privileged operations in Azure AD, Azure, Microsoft 365, or SaaS apps. Organizations can give users just-in-time privileged access to Azure and Azure AD resources and can oversee what those users are doing with their privileged access. License requirements Using this feature requires an Azure AD Premium P2 license. To find the right license for your requirements, see Compare generally available features of Azure AD. For information about licenses for users, see License requirements to use Privileged Identity Management. What does it do? Privileged Identity Management provides time-based and approval-based role activation to mitigate the risks of excessive, unnecessary, or misused access permissions on resources that you care about. Here are some of the key features of Privileged Identity Management: Provide just-in-time privileged access to Azure AD and Azure resources Assign time-bound access to resources using start and end dates Require approval to activate privileged roles Enforce multi-factor authentication to activate any role Use justification to understand why users activate Get notifications when privileged roles are activated Conduct access reviews to ensure users still need roles Download audit history for internal or external audit Prevents removal of the last active Global Administrator and Privileged Role Administrator role assignments What can I do with it?

While it is a simple distinction, this point may cause far more confusion than you might think! Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is a very broad industry term rather than a reference to any specific tools. Many analysts, most notably Forrester, use the term \u2018PIM\u2019 to refer to all things within the \u2018PAM\u2019, or Privileged Access Management, space. PIM and PAM are often used interchangeably to refer to the wider universe of tools and technology that relate to the management, governance, auditing, and lifecycles of all types of privileged access and privileged user credentials. Download now: Azure PIM vs BeyondTrust PAM How Azure PIM Fits within Identity Management With the clarification on terminology aside, any explanation of the Azure PIM tool must first start with a deeper look at Microsoft\u2019s position on identity security. Microsoft has released a whole host of tools, with Azure PIM being one of them, that all relate to their core identity security proposal. In Microsoft\u2019s own words: \u201cIn Azure AD, we replace the network security perimeter with authentication in your organization's identity layer\u201d The idea of identity as a security perimeter is meant to act in lieu of traditional controls placed on the network. For Microsoft, the question is: if you can be more certain that the user accessing a resource is who they say they are, then do you need other controls in place? We view this initiative as a natural evolution of Active Directory\u2019s very basic approach to securing user identities (i.e. just a username and a password). Azure AD takes this to the next level with core features such as: Enhanced MFA, including Windows Hello for Business and MSFT Authenticator Conditional Access: the foundational layer of identity security in Azure AD Azure PIM and Azure Identity Governance Automated Threat Response and Cloud Intelligence solutions Of these features, Conditional Access is by far the most pervasive feature in Microsoft\u2019s identity stack.

Cyber-attackers use credential theft attacks to target administrator accounts and other privileged access to try to gain access to sensitive data. For cloud services, prevention and response are the joint responsibilities of the cloud service provider and the customer. For more information about the latest threats to endpoints and the cloud, see the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report. This article can help you develop a roadmap toward closing the gaps between your current plans and the guidance described here. Note Microsoft is committed to the highest levels of trust, transparency, standards conformance, and regulatory compliance. Learn more about how the Microsoft global incident response team mitigates the effects of attacks against cloud services, and how security is built into Microsoft business products and cloud services at Microsoft Trust Center - Security and Microsoft compliance targets at Microsoft Trust Center - Compliance. Traditionally, organizational security was focused on the entry and exit points of a network as the security perimeter. However, SaaS apps and personal devices on the Internet have made this approach less effective. In Azure AD, we replace the network security perimeter with authentication in your organization's identity layer, with users assigned to privileged administrative roles in control. Their access must be protected, whether the environment is on-premises, cloud, or a hybrid. Securing privileged access requires changes to: Processes, administrative practices, and knowledge management Technical components such as host defenses, account protections, and identity management Secure your privileged access in a way that is managed and reported in the Microsoft services you care about. If you have on-premises administrator accounts, see the guidance for on-premises and hybrid privileged access in Active Directory at Securing Privileged Access.

These best practices are derived from our experience with Azure RBAC and the experiences of customers like yourself. Only grant the access users need Using Azure RBAC, you can segregate duties within your team and grant only the amount of access to users that they need to perform their jobs. Instead of giving everybody unrestricted permissions in your Azure subscription or resources, you can allow only certain actions at a particular scope. When planning your access control strategy, it's a best practice to grant users the least privilege to get their work done. Avoid assigning broader roles at broader scopes even if it initially seems more convenient to do so. When creating custom roles, only include the permissions users need. By limiting roles and scopes, you limit what resources are at risk if the security principal is ever compromised. The following diagram shows a suggested pattern for using Azure RBAC. For information about how to assign roles, see Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal. Limit the number of subscription owners You should have a maximum of 3 subscription owners to reduce the potential for breach by a compromised owner. This recommendation can be monitored in Microsoft Defender for Cloud. For other identity and access recommendations in Defender for Cloud, see Security recommendations - a reference guide. Use Azure AD Privileged Identity Management To protect privileged accounts from malicious cyber-attacks, you can use Azure Active Directory Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to lower the exposure time of privileges and increase your visibility into their use through reports and alerts. PIM helps protect privileged accounts by providing just-in-time privileged access to Azure AD and Azure resources. Access can be time bound after which privileges are revoked automatically.

Not only Exchange Online, but also OneDrive for Business, SharePoint Online, Teams and other cloud services. SharePoint Online a great solution of collaboration solutions, when multiple people are working on multiple documents in a department, group or project style. One of my clients has a department with two employees, but with approx. 4TB of primarily static data. They store data on a file share and store it there for 20 years or more. The directory structure reflect the organization, but also the timeframe, so the directory structure is deep and filenames are typically long. Combine this with the 256 character URL limit in SharePoint and there\u2019s the challenge, you can not simple move this to SharePoint Online. Restructuring the data would be a solution when moving to SharePoint Online, but that would be a massive project. Another solution would be the use of Azure Files, where a file share is created in Azure and where the users can access the files directly in Azure, just like a regular share on the on-premises fileserver. And if you have a low bandwidth and high latency Internet connection, you can always implement a caching server on-premises, where an offline copy is stored on-premises. Compare this to OneDrive for Business where a copy of the data can be stored on your workstation. To create an Azure file share, follow these steps: In the Azure Portal, create a new Resource Group (or use an existing one). To create a new storage account, select All Services in the Azure Portal, and in the all services blade type storage accounts.

In a previous company I migrated the company file shares to Azure using File Sync, which turned the on-premise file server to a caching server. This allowed the users to continue working with the network shares without anything changing from their perspective. I'm curious about the option of moving everything to SharePoint/Teams to get files completey in cloud? Any limitations with this. It would be approx 1TB of data that is currently on our network shares. I like the idea on the surface of having it all in cloud so data can be accessed from anywhere without a VPN, but it would be a shift in functionality for staff and maybe that is it's own headache for IT? Spice (9) Reply (8) flag Report rashley pimiento 8 Replies _V_ chipotle Sep 30th, 2020 at 7:44 AM I haven't messed much with Azure files, because I'm a huge Sharepoint fan. I still prefer on-premise (which can also be accessed externally if you configure it to be so), but Sharepoint adds so much flexibility and functionality. Yes, if your users are accustomed to a old-school file server directory structure, there will be a learning curve for them, but it's worth it IMO. Plus, there are a ton of benefits for IT, even if you have to spend a lot of time up-front training. One advantage is you can push both document access and document management back onto the users. Department heads can manage their own page in Sharepoint, and therefore manage user access to the documents they own. With on-premise Sharepoint you can even have sub-directories (sites) so each department can customize their own page if they desire. Users can recover their own deleted documents through the recycle bin, as well as easily recover earlier document versions. Sharepoint is a great way to handle shared calendars so they no longer have to be managed via Exchange or Outlook, document search functionality is better, and you can generally migrate a lot of other information to Sharepoint, giving you a single (or at least fewer) platform(s) to manage. flag Report 3 found\n[3]: URL: https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2231133-sharepoint-vs-azure-files --- Title: Sharepoint vs Azure files - Office 365 - Spiceworks --- Body: Sharepoint vs Azure files - Office 365 Home Cloud Microsoft Office 365 Sharepoint vs Azure files Posted by pedramhaghzaban on Sep 10th, 2019 at 7:05 AM Needs answer Microsoft Office 365 Hi everyone, I know this question might asked before but our situation is little bit different compare to others. Currently our office has a file server and we recently started using 365 and my goal is to completely move to cloud ( we just have a file server and a dc). And by completely I mean using Azure AD instead of current on premise and use either Sharepoint or Azure files to replace the on premise file server. Most of our files are either documents such as excel, word, pdf, and pictures. Currently the total amount of size is 877GB. But it will be smaller that that since some of them are not important or are installation files. One option is Sharepoint but the challenging part was recreating the permissions (It is already done) and download/upload each file when the user is working on them. The advantage of it that I'm seeing is the multi platform which gives users on pretty much any operating system to access the files. It is also part of our subscription which means it is free for now. The other option is Azure Files but to my Knowledge in past couple days that I've been researching, we need a VM for it either on-prem or over the Azure which adds around $338.43 for both Azure storage and a VM. Now my question is which one of these 2 solutions would work better for now and future?

One of the reasons why I consider choosing Blob Storage over SP Document Libraries is because I use PowerApps. PowerApps can interact with Data from both Blob Storage and SP. But if you are using the PowerApp to interact with a SP list, you can only manage up to 2500 items in your SP list. That is very limiting in a business environment where you are quick to exceed these 2500 items. With Blob Storage a limit of that kind does not exist. Thank you and best regards JHL 1 Like Reply Jay_Calderwood replied to telecaster \u200eMay 29 2020 06:32 AM @telecaster If your customer rarely accesses these files and these are truly archival documents then, this is where the cool storage comes in. It's a few dollars a month and the files just wait there, waiting to be opened. This is good if they are rarely accessed. Whereas a document library will need some sort of care and love. Documents will need to be split up, organized, etc. It's all also on how the client wants to access the data, will it\n[5]: URL: https://steadfastsolutions.com.au/insights/onedrive-vs-sharepoint-vs-microsoft-azure-files --- Title: OneDrive VS SharePoint Vs.

Microsoft Azure Files OneDrive vs SharePoint vs Azure | Steadfast Solutions In the past, businesses relied on USB sticks or hard drives to store and share files. But, due to the advancements in technology, cloud computing has made it possible for users in business networks to easily and quickly transfer files regardless of their locations or the devices they\u2019re using. Depending on your storage, file sharing, and collaboration needs, you\u2019ll choose a tool that has the right features and is within your budget. Comparing OneDrive, SharePoint, and Azure may seem a little difficult because the tools have so much in common. Nonetheless, these three are not the same. Even with this overlap between tools in the Microsoft software-verse, we\u2019ll try and pinpoint the differences between these three file storage and sharing solutions to help pick the right option for your business. OneDrive OneDrive allows you to save all your photos/files and quickly access them from any device regardless of your location. This is a great tech model for anyone who wants to experience the freedom of accessing, editing, and sharing their files or photos on any device. That also means that you won\u2019t lose your files and images even if your device is damaged or gets lost. OneDrive allows users to consistently stay connected with the people they choose to share their files and photos. So, if some of your business partners or remote employees are abroad, you can still share photos, files, folders with them and avoid the hassle of dealing with thumb drives and large email attachments\u2014you send a full OneDrive link through email or text. Besides, files on OneDrive are always encrypted, whether on transit or not, to ensure they don\u2019t appear malicious. Apart from being an online cabinet for storing documents or files, OneDrive is also a reliable platform for versioning and sharing work projects. With the roll-back functionality, you can rest assured that you can retrieve files anytime if you delete or corrupt them accidentally. In addition, the Personal Vault section on OneDrive is designed to ensure that users can securely store their information using a password. OneDrive is an essential tool among the three that is tailored for personal than commercial use.

How can I assist you today?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Draw comparisons between Azure FIle share and Sharepoint "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Azure Files and SharePoint are both cloud-based solutions offered by Microsoft for file storage and sharing. While they have some similarities, there are key differences between the two. \n\nAzure Files is a service that allows you to create a file share in Azure, similar to a traditional file share on an on-premises file server. It is designed for scenarios where you need a scalable and accessible file share that can be accessed from anywhere. With Azure Files, you can store and manage your files in the cloud, and users can directly access those files using standard SMB protocols. Additionally, you can implement a caching server on-premises to store an offline copy of the files for better performance in low-bandwidth scenarios [[1]](https://jaapwesselius.com/2019/09/18/azure-files-instead-of-sharepoint-online).\n\nOn the other hand, SharePoint is a collaboration platform that offers a variety of features for document management, team collaboration, and information sharing. It provides a web-based interface where users can create and manage document libraries, lists, and sites. SharePoint allows for granular control over permissions and versioning, making it suitable for more complex collaboration scenarios. It also offers features such as workflow automation, content search, and integration with other Office 365 services [[3]](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2231133-sharepoint-vs-azure-files).\n\nWhen considering which solution to choose, there are a few factors to consider:\n\n1. Usage: If you primarily need a scalable and accessible file share without the need for extensive collaboration features, Azure Files might be a suitable choice. However, if you require advanced collaboration capabilities, document versioning, and integration with other Office 365 services, SharePoint would be a better fit.\n\n2. File Structure: If you have a deep directory structure or long filenames, SharePoint's 256 character URL limit might pose a challenge. In such cases, Azure Files could be a more practical option [[1]](https://jaapwesselius.com/2019/09/18/azure-files-instead-of-sharepoint-online).\n\n3. Cost: Both Azure Files and SharePoint have their own pricing models. You should consider the storage requirements, data transfer costs, and any additional features or services required when comparing the costs of each solution.\n\nIn summary, Azure Files is a file share service in Azure that provides scalable file storage, while SharePoint is a comprehensive collaboration platform with advanced features for document management and team collaboration. The choice between the two depends on your specific requirements, including the need for collaboration features, file structure limitations, and cost considerations."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you draw the advantanges and disadvantage sofr me in a tabular format?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly!

Secure certificate storage allows you to create runbooks and DSC configurations that use certificates for authentication, or add them to Azure or third-party resources. Note Secure assets in Azure Automation include credentials, certificates, connections, and encrypted variables. These assets are encrypted and stored in Automation by using a unique key that is generated for each Automation account. Automation stores the key in the system-managed Key Vault service. Before storing a secure asset, Automation loads the key from Key Vault, and then uses it to encrypt the asset.

(Photos by Wilson Gajarla, Ashish Sayal, and Dennis Han) Cybersecurity is a constant challenge at Microsoft. To protect the connections between computer servers, resources, and their users, the company regularly uses digital certificates signed by trusted authority providers. Every quarter, the Microsoft Digital team is responsible for some 4,000 digital certificate renewals. At two to four hours to do each one, sometimes more, this used tens of thousands of labor hours every year. What if there were a way to avoid the manual, time-consuming tasks normally associated with certificate renewal? That\u2019s the question that Wilson Gajarla, a senior software engineer in Microsoft Digital, faced after an incident with an important certificate on a local machine in a Microsoft lab at the company headquarters in Redmond. When Gajarla and team noticed that the certificate was about to expire, they realized it would take more than a few hours to renew it. In this case, the lab itself was off-limits due to COVID-19 so the machine wasn\u2019t easily reachable to perform the manual renewal process. Fortunately, Gajarla was granted special permission to enter the building due to business urgency, and was able to renew the certificate in time. But the experience stuck with Gajarla. Gajarla began to look for better ways to manage server security, even in cases where an administrator can\u2019t connect remotely to a machine.

If you only need to retain your events for 90 days or less you do not need to set up archival to a storage account , since Activity Log events are retained in the Azure platform for 90 days without enabling archival.
